"I am a parent judge with experience in PF, LD debate judging. I appreciate clearly identified and well-supported contentions, road mapping, speaking at an understandable pace, and respectful crossfire. I do not appreciate spreading. I like to flow while I'm judging a round. I prefer traditional debate to approaches like counter plans or progressive frameworks.  "
"Hi, I’m a first year out and did 4 years of PF, 2 years of Congress, and dabbled in some Worlds. Email me at fawazahmad@princeton.edu if you have any questions. Overarching things: Tech>Truth: All of us can pretty much agree, most of the arguments we read in PF are bs so I evaluate the round solely on what's presented in the round regardless of the truthfulness of the argument. But remember the more sophisticated your argument gets the lower threshold I have on evaluating responses. Frameworks: I default to a cost/benefit analysis framework. If a team provides a framework for me to evaluate the round under it should be introduced as early as possible and extended throughout all speeches. If there are two frameworks please do the comparative for me and explain why I should pick one over the other. Comparative Analysis: Please do the comparative for me with different arguments. If both teams are running similar arguments do the comparative and tell my why yours is better. If teams are running different arguments (ie one is an economic impact and one is a democracy impact) I need to know why I'm preferring your argument. Absent comparative analysis, I will have to interpret things on my own and you don't want that. Extension: Extending only the authors and taglines of cards doesn't suffice for me. You need to extend the substance of the card as well and how they relate to your impact. If you want me evaluate something in FF is should be included in the summary speech. I usually allow first speaking teams to extend defense straight to final focus but in reality you should be mentioning important defense extensions in summary. Progressive args: I don't have that much experience with progressive arguments. I really don't like theory debates but will tolerate them. Run these types of arguments with caution. If you run them with me explain them really well in round.  Other things: -I will not flow cross. If something important happened in cross mention it in speech.- When time stops, I will stop flowing. Anything said over the time limit will not factor into my RFD- Quality over Quantity; don't spread. If you plan on speaking fast please send a speech doc. If I can't understand you I'll say clear and after 3 times I'll stop flowing. - Second rebuttal should respond to turns/disads. - Please collapse on a few arguments in summary. I prefer quality over quantity and clear extensions. - Weigh, weigh, weigh (as early as possible in the round) - Implicate turns and defense - Please don't miscut (I will drop you) -There's nothing more I hate than long speeches in cross GLHF "
"I have coached debate since 1971, beginning at Manchester (now Manchester Essex) from 1971-2005, and now at Waring School since 2005. I have coached national champions in both policy debate and public forum debate, so I can flow a debate. I am a ""tabula rasa"" judge, meaning that I believe that the debaters (and not my personal opinions or delivery preferences) will determine what issues and arguments should win the debate. I grew up in Kansas and debated for Topeka West High School (1962-65), where all judges were citizens of the host community. All of our debate was conducted in front of ""citizen judges."" That's what I believe is most important in PFD. The event was designed so that it would be persuasive to an intelligent and attentive member of the ""public."" For that reason, I feel that the delivery, argumentation, and ethos of the debaters should be directly accessible to such an audience. I do agree that dropped arguments are conceded in the debate and that NEW arguments in the final speeches should be ignored. I love it when debaters are directly responsive to the arguments of the other side, letting me know on a point by point basis where they are on the flow. I also honor those debaters who show courtesy to their opponents, who have a sense of humor, and who tell the truth about what they have said. I expect that all evidence will be ethically researched and presented in the debate. I will penalize (with points) any debaters who are sarcastic, demeaning of opponents, or biased in terms of race, religion, sexual orientation, or social class. I will always be happy to talk with you about any decision I make as well as to show you my flow and explain how I assessed the debate. I will do this AFTER I have submitted my ballot. In recent years, I have been spending more of my time in tab rooms than judging, but I truly enjoy the time I can spend in the back of the room. In these trying times, you debaters are our hope for the future, naming FACT-BASED arguments about important issues. Tim Averill (timaverill@comcast.net) 978-578-0540 "
"About Me i am the beach. In the 2021/2022 school year I will likely be judging less, so I may be slightly rusty. I still am not a brick, and PF is still not that tech, so there shouldn't be any issue. Just a fair warning. Online Debate- General I require email chains for constructive and anything in rebuttal that isn’t analytics. My email is dylan.beach01@gmail.com Bonus +1 speaks if you send cut cards for anything you send paraphrased. Not providing it on the chain is an auto 26, and I won't be very happy, because I believe not sending docs disadvantages teams with worse internet access. **** Yes. This means send full rebuttal documents. Why is this not common practice???!***** General Info 1. At times I’ve been called a weighing hack, and I guess I understand why. Above all else, I am going to vote for the biggest impact in the round if two teams go for different impacts. I find anything else is intervening, which I hate. I evaluate weighing as I would framing, in rounds where framing is not present. Thus, impact weighing is not a tiebreaker where I determine which arguments have access to the link then decide which argument has the biggest impact, but rather where I look at the resolved weighing debate, and ONLY evaluate the impact which wins said weighing debate. Resolve the weighing in the round early, and my ballot will be quite easy. 2. I have conflicting thoughts on defense. At this current moment in time, I believe that in order for defense to be terminal, it only has to be implicated as such and be resolved against frontlines. If these criteria are not met, I will assume there is a small but nonzero risk of a link story happening, which bears the risk of allowing your opponents the ability to win the round off of the framing debate and a risk of a link. I also believe defense is not sticky, it doesn't make sense for an argument to be extended from first rebuttal to first summary. I think this norm made sense when summary was only two minutes, but it should have died when the NSDA changed this speech to three minutes. 3. I am good with speed, but please give me speech docs and slow down a bit in the back half. Add me to the email chain: dylan.beach01@gmail.com. I also hate teams who read 40 paraphrased responses in rebuttal with no warrants and don’t at least slow down when they’re switching between arguments. 4. I hate intervening. I was not an ethical debater, and as a result, I don't really care much about things like evidence ethics or academic integrity. You can lie, you can read false evidence, etc. If it is not called out, I will not do anything. In my view, my role as a judge is not to be an educator or anything, but rather to be a blank slate in the back of the room. All the ""educating"" can wait for after the round, but I see no need and have no desire to meddle with the content of the round. 5. I like warrants, but I dislike intervening more. That means if you extend a contention with no warrant, I will unfortunately vote off it if your opponent drops it/doesn't point it out. But, if they do point out it's no warrant I'll treat the ""no warrant"" response as terminal defense and won't vote off the contention. Just have warrants please, I'll tank your speaks if you don't. 6. Tag Team CX is allowed, I think it's a good thing. I largely do not care about cross, I am probably not paying attention anyways. 7.You have to frontline everything in second rebuttal. If you get a bunch of arguments dumped on you, then you should be collapsing (this should happen in every second rebuttal imo). I will consider anything not frontlined in 2nd rebuttal conceded. 8. I am surprised that I have to say this, but ANY ARGUMENT has to be responded to by the speech immediately following it (obvious exception for constructive case level arguments, not gonna make you diverge from the norm in PF.) However, there is one exception. If the first constructive reads framing or theory, the second constructive MUST RESPOND. If first constructive theory or framing is not responded to in the second constructive, it's conceded, and you can probably defer to the TKO rules below. 9. TKO- If you think there are no paths to the ballot possible, then you can stand up, be like "" TECHNICAL KNOCKOUT THEY CAN'T WIN "" - this will stop the round, if you do this and I think you're correct, then I'll award you W 30's. Please do not be afraid to do this, I have often found myself bored and wishing debaters used this option. Conversely, if you are getting nuked in a round, and would like to end the round early, you can forfeit the round (prior to grand cross) and I'll give you the L but give you double 30's. 10. Asking questions after the round is fine. Light post rounding is fine. Be aggressive/disrespectful at your own risk, I will probably match your energy as well as dock speaks. Theory. ***If you are in varsity at a TOC bid tournament, I will by NO MEANS evaluate a ""we do not understand theory/theory excludes me because I don't know how to debate it"" response. In fact, I will give you the lowest speaker points the tournament reasonably permits-- you're perpetuating horrible norms in this activity. Do not enter the varsity division of tournaments if you are unwilling to handle varsity level argumentation. *** As an aside to this ^, if you read anything from this article as a reason why theory is bad, I'm probably just going to intervene. This is one of the worst takes I've ever heard, and I'm really sick of people perpetuating the narrative that ""public forum should be for the public"" or whatever dumb thing boomers in this activity who are afraid of anyone that isn't a cishet white male doing well in the activity propagate. this is the one spot I feel 0 shame in intervening, I will laugh at you while I do it and play Laughing To The Bank by Chief Keef while I read the decision. I believe that I am the correct judge to read theory in front of, often I find a well-executed theory debate both more interesting and easier to evaluate than a substance debate of the same caliber. I do not care if you're reading friv shells, it's probably funny. I dislike paragraph theory, and strongly prefer shell format. I will still vote for paragraph shells (again, not going to intervene,) but I would probably have a low threshold to pull the trigger on ""theory must be in shell format"" interps. This is definitely the only area in which I am strongly biased, to be honest, so read para theory at your own risk. An interpretation can only be read immediately after the violation occurs. Conversely, a counterinterp can only be read immediately after the initial interpretation is read. The latest I will evaluate an interp is the FIRST summary speech.  some defaults people have informed me are helpful: text over spirit of interp Yes RVI's Competing Interps (legit have no clue how to resolve rounds under reasonability pls don't make me do it) Fairness O/W Education voter metatheory 1st K's  I think I'm competent enough compared to the average Public Forum judge to evaluate any K that gets read in Public Forum (performance args, cap, sec, setcol, neolib, etc.) However, I am not one of the judges who are increasingly abundant in Public Forum, that will just hack for any perf args. I really enjoy judging K debate, so it's disappointing when it's done poorly, and equally disappointing when judges hack for a poor execution of the K so as to avoid being viewed as problematic. (Ironically, though, I have never downed the K, but this is more likely due to PF debaters handling these arguments very poorly.) If you are going to swing wildly outside of the PF meta, and read phil-rooted args, I am going to be confused and will require a lot of slow explanation. Make sure you're extending the ROTB, alt, link-- every part of the K, in order to garner offense. I also by default believe that the theory page comes before the K page, as theory exists to determine what parameters the K can be evaluated under, but I could definitely be convinced otherwise. Weighing I've gone back and forth with this for a while, but I think probability is just a function of the strength of an argument's link. That's the only objective way for me to evaluate arguments, and as a result I think that your mitigatory defense should just be leveraged into warrants for why you comparatively outweigh. I also consider arguments like evidence indicts as things that merely diminish an argument's strength of link, instead of entirely defeating the argument. Just keep that in mind. Refer to the ""General Info"" section part 1 for everything else. Evidence I'll never call for evidence if it sounds too good to be true and nobody called it out. I will also not do anything with evidence that I see after the round, unless there is an implication made IN THE ROUND to the indict being true. Speaker Point Magnifiers  I am actually pretty harsh with speaks in a lot of rounds. I think a lot of judges pretend teams debate far better than they did, but I have no qualms about giving 26’s or whatever if you annoy me. You should use a lot of these tools to up your speaks to mitigate this as much as possible. If I pick up your ballot and you're in the bracket where you're not eligible for elims, I'm sorry. It's tough, but please make these rounds interesting, I get if you're new to the activity, but a lot of times people just don't care. If you're not gonna care, at least be funny. I don't wanna be bored, so here's funny stuff you can do to up your speaks- 1. ""joe mama "" your opponents somehow ( don't just say "" do you know joe "" in cx, or say "" can I see your Joe card "" that's lame. be creative. ) 2. Dunk on your opponents like my boy Seth Winterton would- with the exception of being problematic, clown around as much as you’d like, it’ll probably be hilarious. 3. send me proof that you have FMAB at a 10 on your MAL 4. call me any name that has "" beach "" in it ( some i've heard: big dog beach, senator beach, sir beach, ronald mcbeach, general beach, etc ) 5. give your speech in brace belden's Coin Dexter or Gourmand voice (or drop other TrueAnon references) 6. reference the worst debater of all time (iykyk) Final Thoughts If there's anything you felt weighed in on my decision that wasn't something you could collect from reading this paradigm, let me know. I tried to make my paradigm fairly extensive so you could get a good feel for how I view the activity. Debate is a pretty fun game, so you should play the game in whatever way you find enjoyable. Learn how to communicate with people, how to network, how to research, etc. However, don't use your time in the game to limit the fun other players have, or reduce the marginal amount of education this game rewards some players with. Everyone in this activity is young and impressionable, and there are a plethora of lessons this game could teach any of us at any time. As an individual who grew up in a ""white trash"" environment where things such as racism and bigotry were normalized and even permeated my own ideology, this game has helped individuals such as myself consider and accept a broader array of perspectives, and has equipped individuals who have been discriminated against historically with the capacity to engage in dialogue in a quasi-equitable environment. If every player in the game recognized and respected this, the community would probably be more enjoyable for all participants. - big dog beach "
"Background: I debated PF at Auburn High School. I have a BS in Economics from Auburn University and am working on my MS in Economics at Portland State University. This is my fifth year judging. I'm a flow judge. I judge the round based almost purely off of what is left on the flow after final focus. This means that I value clear voters and good line by line very highly. Crossfire: I do not flow crossfire. Any points made in crossfire must be brought up in a speech for me to weigh it in the round. If debaters are rude during crossfire it will be reflected in their speaker points. Evidence: If debaters cannot produce evidence in less than a minute, I assume that they do not have the card. I will ask for cards after the round if I am not clear on the intentions of the author or believe that the card was miscut. "
"Yes, I want to be on the email chain - shabbirmbohri@gmail.com. Label email chains with the tournament, round, and both teams. Send DOCS, not your excessively paraphrased case + 55 cards in the email chain. I debated 3 years of PF at Coppell High School. I am now a Public Forum Coach at the Quarry Lane School. Standing Conflicts: Coppell HS, Quarry Lane, Brookfield East (2021-), Ransom RT (2021-) If there are 5 things to take from my paradigm, here they are: 1. Read what you want. Don't change your year-long strategies for what I may or may not like - assuming the argument is not outright offensive, I will evaluate it. My paradigm gives my preferences on each argument, but you should debate the way you are most comfortable with. 2. Send speech docs. I mean this - Speaks are capped at a 27.5 for ANY tournament in a Varsity division if you are not at a minimum sending constructive with cards. If you paraphrase, send what you read and the cards. Send word docs or google docs, not 100 cards in 12 separate emails. +0.2 speaks for rebuttal docs as well. 3. Don't lie about evidence. I've seen enough shitty evidence this year to feel comfortable intervening on egregiously bad evidence ethics. I won't call for evidence unless the round feel impossible to decide or I have been told to call for evidence, but if it is heavily misconstrued, you will lose. 4. Be respectful. This should be a safe space to read the arguments you enjoy. If someone if offensive or violent in any way, the round will be stopped and you will lose. 5. Extend, warrant, weigh. Applicable to whatever event you're in - easiest way to win any argument is to do these 3 things better than the other team and you'll win my ballot. Online Debate Update: Establish a method for evidence exchange PRIOR to the start of the round, NOT before first crossfire. Cameras on at all times. Here's how I'll let you steal prep - if your opponents take more than 2 minutes to search for, compile, and send evidence, I'll stop caring if you steal prep in front of me. This should encourage both teams to send evidence quickly. PF Overview: All arguments should be responded to in the next speech outside of 1st constructive. If is isn't, the argument is dropped. Theory, framing, ROBs are the exception to this as they have to be responded to in the next speech. Every argument in final focus should be warranted, extended, and weighed in summary/FF to win you the round. Missing any one of these 3 components is likely to lose you the round. Frontlining in 2nd rebuttal is required. I don't get the whole ""frontline offense but not defense"" - collapse, frontline the argument, and move on. Defense isn't sticky - extend everything you want in the ballot in summary, including dropped defense. Theory: I believe that disclosure is good and paraphrasing is bad. I will not hack for these arguments, but these are my personal beliefs that will influence my decision if there is absolutely no objective way for me to choose a winner. I will vote on paraphrasing good, but your speaks will get nuked. I think trigger warnings are bad. The use of them in PF have almost always been to allow a team to avoid interacting with important issues in round because they are afraid of losing, and the amount of censorship of those arguments I've seen because of trigger warnings has led me to this conclusion. I will vote on trigger warning theory if there is an objectively graphic description of something that is widely considered triggering, and there is no attempt to increase safety for the competitors by the team reading it, but other than that I do not see myself voting on this shell often. I think RVI's are good in PF when teams kick theory. Otherwise, you should 100% read a counter-interp. Reasonability is too difficult to adjudicate in my experience, and I prefer an interp v CI debate. K's/Non-Topical Positions: There are dozens of these, and I hardly know 3-4. However, as with any other argument, explain it well and prove why it means you should win. I expect there to be distinct ROBs I can evaluate/compare, and if you are reading a K you should delineate for me whether you are linking to the resolution (IMF is bad b/c it is a racist institution) OR your opponents link to the position (they securitized Russia). I think K's should give your opponent's a chance to win - I will NOT evaluate ""they cannot link in"" or ""we win b/c we read the argument first"". Other: If you read Empiricus 200AD in any round, I will guarantee you a 30. If you do not know what this is, please contact justinzhang0706@gmail.com to get this argument. I will boost speaks if you disclose (+0.1), read cut cards in rebuttal (+0.2), and do not take over 2 mins to compile and send evidence (+0.1). Ask me in round for questions about my paradigm, and feel free to ask me questions after round as well. "
"Hi! I have no previous experience with debate, and I do not know all the rules that go along with it. I do believe that it is important to respond to the entirety of the other person's argument while also maintaining respect among competitors! "
"Jane Boyd School: Grapevine HS -Retired Email: janegboyd79@gmail.com School affiliation/s – Grapevine HS, Texas Years Judging/Coaching - 37 Years of Experience Judging any Speech/Debate Event 37 Table of contents: World school Debate Public Forum LD Policy/CX ____________________________________________________________________________ WORLD SCHOOL DEBATE I have experience and success coaching American Style Debates. Worlds Schools Debate quickly has become my most favorite. I have coached teams to elimination rounds at local, state, and The NSDA National tournament every year that I coached WSD. I judge WSD regularly and often. The main thing to know is I follow the norms of WSD (that you all have access). I don't want WSD Americanized. How would you describe WS Debate to someone else? WSD is a classic debate. The type when folks think about the debate. Much more based on logic and classic arguments with some evidence but not evidence heavy. It is NOT an American-style debate. What process, if any, do you utilize to take notes in the debate? I flow each speech. When evaluating the round, assuming both principle and practical arguments are advanced through the 3rd and Reply speeches, do you prefer one over the other? Explain. I look at both. Does the principle have merit and the practical is the tangible explanation? I don’t think that the practical idea has to solve but is it a good idea. The WS Debate format requires the judge to consider both Content and Style as 40% each of the speaker’s overall score, while Strategy is 20%. How do you evaluate a speaker’s strategy? Strategy is argument selection in speeches 2, 3, and 4. In 1st speech, it is how the case is set up and does it give a good foundation for other speeches to build. WS Debate is supposed to be delivered at a conversational pace. What category would you deduct points in if the speaker was going too fast? The style mostly, but if it is really fast then maybe strategy as well. WS Debate does not require evidence/cards to be read in the round. How do you evaluate competing claims if there is no evidence to read? The argument that makes the most sense, is extended throughout the debate and does it have the basics of claim, warrant, and impact. How do you resolve model quibbles? Models are simply an example of how the resolution would work. Which model is best explained, extended, and directly compared? If those are even, which one makes the most intuitive sense to me. How do you evaluate models vs. countermodels? Models and counter models are simply examples of how the resolution would work. Which model is best explained, extended, and directly compared. If those are even, which one makes the most intuitive sense to me. _____________________________________________________________________________________ Public Forum Debate I am more of a traditionalist on PFD. I don't really like fast PFD. The time constraints just don't allow it. No plans or counter plans. Disadvantages can be run but more traditional and not calling it a disadvantage. I have experience with every type of debate so words like link cross-apply, drop -- are ok with me. The summary and final focus should be used to start narrowing the debate to the most important issues with a direct comparison of impacts and worldview I flow - IF you share cases put me on the email chain but I won't look at it until the end and ONLY if evidence or arguments are challenged. Speak with the assumption that I am flowing not reading. _____________________________________________________________________________________ LD: What many think is progressive debate was done originally in 98-99 by Grapevine Debaters. We just did it better. A good debate is a good debate. Keep in mind that trying to be cutting edge does NOT make for good debate by itself. While I appreciate innovation - I hate tricks for the sake of tricks. Keep that in mind. Framework/Values/Criteria/Standards/Burdens Standards, criteria, framework, and/or burdens serve as the same thing - these are mechanisms on how to determine who wins the debate. If a value is used it needs to be defended throughout the case and not simply an afterthought. The framework of the debate should not be longer than the rest of the case. Unless it is necessary to make the framework clear, cut to the chase and tell me what is acceptable and not acceptable, but don't spend 2 1/2 minutes on something that should take just a few sentences to make clear. I want to hear substantive debate on the topic, not excessive framework or theory. Note the word excessive. I am not stupid and usually get it much quicker than you think. In the debate resolve the issue of standard and link it to the substantive issues of the round then move on. Evidence and Basic Argumentation: The evidence adds credibility to the arguments of the case however I don't want to just hear you cite sources without argumentation and analysis of how it applies to the clash in the debate. I don't like arguments that are meant to confuse and say absolutely nothing of substantive value. I am fine with philosophy but expect that you can explain and understand the philosophies that you are applying to your case or arguments. A Kritik is nothing new in LD. Traditional LD by nature is perfect, but I recognize the change that has occurred. I accept plans, DAs, counter plans, and theory (when there is a violation - not as the standard strategy.) Theory, plans, and counter plans must be run correctly - so make sure you know how to do it before you run it in front of me. Flow and Voters: I think that the AR has a very difficult job and can often save time by grouping and cross-applying arguments, please make sure you are clearly showing me the flow where you are applying your arguments. I won't cross-apply an argument to the flow if you don't tell me to. I try not to intervene in the debate and only judge based upon what you are telling me and where you are telling me to apply it. Please give voters; however, don't give 5 or 6. You should be able to narrow the debate down to the critical areas. If an argument is dropped, then make sure to explain the importance or relevance of that argument don't just give me the ""it was dropped so I win the argument."" I may not buy that it is an important argument; you have to tell me why it is important in this debate. Presentation: I can flow very well. Speed isn't a problem, it is usually clarity that is the problem. Unless words are clear I won't flow the debate. If I am not writing then you probably need to adapt. Speed for the sake of speed is not a good idea. Kritik: I have been around long enough to have seen the genesis of Kritik arguments. I have seen them go from bad to worse, and then good in the policy. I think that K's arguments are in a worse state in LD now. Kritik is absolutely acceptable IF it applies to the resolution and specifically the case being run in the round. I have the same expectation here as in policy the ""K"" MUST have a specific link. ""K"" arguments MUST link directly to what is happening in THIS round with THIS resolution. I am NOT a fan of a generic Kritik that questions if we exist or not and has nothing to do with the resolution or debate at hand. Kritik must give an alternative other than ""think about it."" Most LD is asking me to take any action with a plan or an objective - a K needs to do the same thing. That being said, I will listen to the arguments but I have a very high threshold for the bearer to meet before I will vote on a ""K"" in LD. Theory: I have a very high threshold of acceptance of theory in LD. There must be a clear abuse story. Also, coming from a policy background - it is essential to run the argument correctly. For example having a violation, interpretation, standards, and voting issues on a Topicality violation is important. Also knowing the difference between topicality and extra-tropical. or knowing what non-unique really means is important. Theory for the sake of a time suck is silly and won't lead me to vote on it at the end. I want to hear substantive debate on the topic, not just a generic framework or theory. RVI's: Not a fan. Congratulations you are topical or met a minimum of your burden I guess? It's not a reason for me to vote though unless you have a compelling reason why. _____________________________________________________________________________________ Policy Debate: Good Debate is a good debate. I flow from the speech not from the document. I do want to be on the email chain though. I prefer good substantive debate on the issues. While Ks are ok if you are going to read them, make sure they are understandable from the beginning. Theory - the same. If you think you might go for it in the end, make sure they are understandable from the beginning. Be aware, on virtual, sometimes hard to understand rapid and unclear speech (it is magnified on virtual). Make necessary adjustments. Links should be specific and not generic. This is everything from K to DA. The final speech needs to tell the story and compare worlds. Yes, line by line is important but treat me like a policymaker - tell me why your policy or no policy would be best. "
"I am primarily a tabula rasa judge, adjudicating arguments as presented in the round. Theoretical arguments are fine as long as they contain the necessary standards and voting issue components. I am not a huge fan of the kritik in PF and tend to reside in that camp that believes such discussions violate the legitimacy of tournament competitions; that being said, I will entertain the argument as well as theoretical counter arguments that speak to its legitimacy, but be forewarned that shifting the discussion to another topic and away from the tournament-listed resolution presents serious questions in my mind as to the respect owed to teams that have done the resolutional research deemed appropriate by the NSDA. I am adept at flowing but cannot keep up with exceptionally fast-paced speaking and see this practice as minimizing the value of authentic communication. I will do my best but may not render everything on the flow to its fullest potential. Please remember that debate is both an exercise in argumentation as well as a communication enterprise. Recognizing the rationale behind the creation of public forum debate underscores this statement. As a result, I am an advocate for debate as an event that involves the cogent, persuasive communication of ideas. Debaters who can balance argumentation with persuasive appeal will earn high marks from me. Signposting, numbering of arguments, crystallization, and synthesis of important issues are critical practices toward winning my ballot, as are diction, clarity, and succinct argumentation. The rationality that supports an argument or a clear link chain will factor into my decision making paradigm. RFD is usually based on a weighing calculus - I will look at a priori arguments first before considering other relevant voters in the round. On a side note: I am not fond of debaters engaging with me as I explain a decision; that being said, I am happy to entertain further discussion via email should a situation warrant. "
"*anthonyrbrown85@gmail.com for the chain* Background Currently the head coach at Southlake Carroll. The majority of my experience is in Public Forum but I’ve spent time either competing or judging every event. General Please show up to the round pre-flowed and ready to go You would probably classify me as a flay judge. The easiest way to win my ballot is through comparative weighing. Explain why your links are clearer and stronger and how your impacts are more important than those of your opponents. Speed is fine but if I miss something that is crucial to your case because you can’t speak fast and clearly at the same time then that’ll be your fault. If you really want to avoid this issue then I would send a speech doc if you plan on going more than 225 wpm. I do not flow cross so if anything important was said mention it in a speech. I would classify myself as tech over truth but let’s not get too crazy. Speaking Typical speaks are between 27-30. I don’t give many 30s but it’s not impossible to get a 30 from me. I would much rather you sacrifice your speed for clarity. If you can’t get to everything that you need to say then it would probably be best to prioritize your impacts and do a great job weighing. Any comments that are intended (or unintended in certain circumstances) to be discriminatory in any form will immediately result in the lowest possible speaker points. PF Specific I’m probably not evaluating your K or theory argument at a non-bid tournament. If you’re feeling brave then you can go for it but unless the literature is solid and it is very well run, I’m going to feel like you’re trying to trick out of the debate by utilizing a style that is not yet a norm and your opponents likely did not plan for. If we're at a bid tournament or state, go for it. Don’t just extend card names and dates without at least briefly reminding me what that card said. Occasionally I write down the content of the card but not the author so if you just extend an author it won’t do you any good. LD Specific (This is not my primary event so I would make sure I check this) Cheatsheet (1 is most comfortable, 5 is lowest) Policy: 1 Theory: 2 K: 3 Phil: 4 Tricks: 5 I’ll understand your LARP arguments. I’ll be able to follow your spreading. I can evaluate most K’s but am most comfortable with identity K’s. I will understand your theory arguments but typically don't buy RVIs. Past that, I’m still getting fully comfortable judging LD so I would over-explain if you don’t fall into those categories and adjust if possible. "
"Add me on the email chain: nilu6060@gmail.com. Teams must send case and rebuttal docs. Short Version American Heritage School ‘19 Georgia Tech ‘22 I'm voting off the flow so put any offense you want in final focus in summary. First summary only needs to extend defense on arguments that were frontlined in second rebuttal. Second rebuttal should answer all offense on the flow. Tech > truth, but the best teams win on both fronts. Long Version Presumption: - If you want me to vote on presumption, please tell me, or else I'll probably try to find some very minimal offense on the flow that you may consider nonexistent. - I will default neg on presumption, but you can make the argument that presumption flows aff. Extensions: - The warrant and impact of an offensive argument must be extended in summary and final focus in order for me to evaluate it. - Your extensions can be very quick for parts of the debate that are clearly conceded. Weighing: - Good weighing will usually win you my ballot and give you a speaker point boost, but please avoid: 1. Weighing that is not comparative 2. Weighing instead of adequately answering the defense on your arguments 3. Strength of link weighing - this is just another word for probability and sometimes probability weighing is just defense that should've been read in rebuttal 4. New weighing in second final focus that isn't responding to new weighing analysis from the first ff. Evidence: - I will read any evidence that is contested or key to my decision at the end of the round. - I won't drop a team on miscut evidence unless theory is read. I will drop speaks and probably drop the argument unless there's a very good reason not to. Speed: - Go as fast as you want but I'd prefer it if you didn't spread. - Don't sacrifice clarity for speed. If I can't understand it, it isn't on the flow. Progressive Argumentation: - I have a good understanding of theory and have voted on less conventional shells albeit my threshold for a response and your speaks could go down. Please read theory as soon as the violation occurs. For example, don't wait till rebuttal to read your disclosure shell. - I wouldn't trust myself to correctly evaluate a K. Most of the time I judge Ks I find myself thinking they don't really cause any change. You can read a K at your own risk and I will try my best to properly evaluate it. - If there are multiple layers of prog. (ie theory vs K vs random IVI) do some sort of weighing between them. - I don't evaluate 30 speaks theory. I tend to believe disclosure is good, but won't intervene. Other things: - I think speaks are arbitrary, but humor helps, especially sarcasm. - Paradigm issues not mentioned here are up for debate within the round - Reading cards > paraphrasing, but paraphrasing is fine - Postrounding is fine - Preflow before the round start time - I will not vote on explicitly oppressive arguments.

"I am a student at cornell and I did PF in high school, which means I will be flowing throughout the debate. Here are some things that I think are important: - since I have debate experience I understand debate jargons, but I don't keep up with resolutions so be clear if you're gonna use acronyms/ resolution terms. - make it easier for me to judge. weigh your arguments, have clear but concise signposting, extend points, which points to vote on, etc - make sure your evidence is WARRANTED - don't yell during cross please. it especially annoys me when debaters throw passive-aggressive/rude remarks. - speak CLEARLY. I don't mind if you speak fast as long as it's clear and comprehensible. - most importantly, be respectful and be honest. i usually don't like to keep time so be honest about your prep time "
"Experience with LD and PF -Good with Speed & spreading -Looking for opponents who give me full expanded thoughts and examples; excellent POI’s and cross exams -for me, debates are won during the crosses -ask thoughtful questions and find holes in opponents arguments -flay judge: competed in high school (07-09) and have been judging lots of online tournaments since the pandemic. Can flow fairly well, but some of the jargon has gone out the window in the past few years, so laymen's terms are preferred when it comes to technically things. I have a college education, but some speech specific language, I don't remember.    "
"Hello debaters, My name is Ana Maria. My daughter (Nicole Rodriguez from Ransom GR) has done PF for 4 years, and I've judged at a few tournaments. Please speak clearly, be respectful during the round, and do not introduce new arguments in final focus. I will take my personal opinions out of the debate and do my best to flow. I know you all work hard and want to do well.  Best of luck! Ana Maria Czachor  (For the email chain: anamariaczachor@yahoo.com) "
"[Background] I am currently at UT Austin majoring in Finance & History. I also debate for the University and work as an Assistant PF Coach at Seven Lakes. Previously, I debated at Vista Ridge in PF reaching State & TOC. Conflicts: Seven Lakes (TX), Vista Ridge (TX), Interlake (WA). Add me to the chain: amod.daherkar@utexas.edu -- [Evidence] Evidence ethics can make or break a round. I expect properly cut cards that can be produced in a timely manner at your opponent’s request. If you take more than 1 minute locating “evidence” I will run your prep time. I do not expect disclosure full-text or otherwise and I am also okay with paraphrasing, though I do not prefer this. I am open to evaluating and voting off disclosure & paraphrasing theory. [Argumentation] This is really up to you; you’re debating not me. However, I do prefer weighing or framing coming out of the 1st rebuttal. 2nd rebuttals are expected to frontline AND collapse. I prefer line-by-line summaries and I don’t have a preference for how you treat final focus. Please make your weighing comparative. Repeating your impact and tagging “scope” and/or “magnitude” after it is not weighing, it’s just proving to me you know how to memorize a number. [Speed/Speaks] I am okay with speed so long as you don’t sound like “hghghhdhhhss.” Speaker points generally range from 28-29.5. This is largely based off my subjective view of how articulate and convincing you sound as a debater. Although I am not extremely invested in crossfire this will affect your speaks. Please avoid being an unnecessary prick in cross unless it is tied to making a tasteful joke.  -- Feel free to ask questions after the round, I am here to help you learn and improve. Other paradigms I agree with: Jack Hayes, Jonathan Daugherty, Max Fuller, & Nahom Tulu. "
"Hello, I did Public Forum debate all four years of high school. I should be able to follow a decent speed, but speed doesn't impress me and I will not flow anything that I can't understand. Being able to understand your team will be especially important with this tournament being held via Zoom. I want to hear clear, concise arguments that are carried throughout the round. Treat your partner and opponent with respect, and have fun.  "
"I am an Americorps service member with less formal debate training. My ballot is awarded to the team with the best speaking skills, articulation of their arguments throughout the whole round, proper refutation of all their opponent's points, usage of evidence, and comparative argumentation. Speed and jargon are a no. Please don't immediately presume I know the intricacies of deep research on the resolution. The point of a public forum debate is that you should be able to break down the debate on the resolution for anyone and convince them why your side is right. Finding a way to make me care about your side by bringing out your emotions is a plus. Being mean or a bully does the opposite. Be sure to time your own speeches and keep track of prep time. I'll also be keeping time, but there is a speaker point reduction for those who don't do it. "
"ALMOST EVERY ROUND I HAVE JUDGED IN THE LAST 7 YEARS WOULD HAVE BENEFITTED FROM 50% FEWER ARGUMENTS, AND 100% MORE ANALYSIS OF THOSE 50% FEWER ARGUMENTS. A Narrative, a Story carries so much more persuasively through a round than the summary speaker saying ""we are going for Contention 2"". I am NOT a fan of speed, nor speed/spread. Please don't make me think I'm in a Policy Round! I don't need ""Off-time roadmaps"", I just want to know where you are starting. Claim/warrant/evidence/impact is NOT a debate cliche`; It is an Argumentative necessity! A label and a blip card is not a developed argument! Unless NUCLEAR WINTER OR NUCLEAR EXTINCTION HAS ALREADY OCCURED, DON'T BOTHER TO IMPACT OUT TO IT. SAVE K'S FOR POLICY ROUNDS; RUN THEORY AT YOUR OWN RISK- I start from ma place that it is fake and abusive in PF and you are just trying for a cheap win against an unprepared team. I come to judge debates about the topic of the moment. YOU MIGHT be able to convince me of your sincerity if you can show me that you run it in every round and are President of the local ""Advocacy for that Cause"" Club. Don't just tell me that you win an argument, show me WHY you win it and what significance that has in the round. Please NARROW the debate and WEIGH arguments in Summary and Final Focus. If you want the argument in Final Focus, be sure it was in the summary. There is a difference between ""passionate advocacy"" and anger. Audio tape some of your rounds and decide if you are doing one or the other when someone says you are ""aggressive"". NSDA evidence rules require authors' last name and THE DATE (minimum) so you must AT LEAST do that if you want me to accept the evidence as ""legally presented"". If one team notes that the other has not supplied dates, it will then become an actual issue in the round. Speaker points are at stake. In close rounds I want to be persuaded and I may just LISTEN to both Final Focus speeches, checking off things that are extended on my flow. I am NOT impressed by smugness, smiling sympathetically at the ""stupidity"" of your opponent's argument, vigorous head shaking in support of your partner's argument or opposition to your opponents'. Speaker points are DEFINITELY in play here! "
"tl:dr: flay - pls email me cases with ur cards, this makes life easy for all of us: sylviaelizabethduarte@gmail.com. if you have any questions about my paradigm, message me on fb i debated on the pf nat'l circuit in high school and am now a college sophomore. quick bio: i would say i'm tech>truth but that is a lie. i like args within the realm of topical possibility. not necessarily probability since most debate args do not work irl anyway lmao. more like, i give less credence to args like nuke war or existentialism and will be looking for any excuse of a response to turn it down (obvs this depends on the topic like yk what i mean). obvs if there is no ink on ur arg or your frontlines are fire and ur debating is of a high caliber, that is different. but idk if ur that guy + why risk it? i give more credence to your args 1) the earlier they are introduced in round, 2) the more warranted they are, 3) the more likely/severe/quickly/generally more important your link chain or impacts are vs your opponents'. - best ways to win my ballot (in order of importance): - effective, consistent, *extended*, good ol warranting. absent good weighing/impact calc, i will likely prefer one well-warranted arg over multiple unwarranted args (yes it will be strategic to collapse in front of me). **this will be to your benefit if you want to go progressive and run something funky like theory and can articulate amazing reasons why it's good to do so.** - complete claim-warrant-impact (frontlined when necessary) extensions in the second half for args you want me to vote for. anything i vote off of in your final focus must be in the summary btw - GOOD weighing. weighing is inherently comparative. ik you think your arg is important, but why is it more important than your opponents'? why does this mean you win the round? - things i dislike but am forced to ignore because i don't want to intervene but also will still rly negatively bias my decision to vote for you because i am human: - speaking at a million words per min. a wise man once said, ""why waste time say lot word when few word do trick?"" and you're on a computer and wifi can cut out and your super-speed-speaking legit won't matter. - doing the above but thinking you're in the clear because you sent a speech doc with your tags afterwords. NO pls stop - heavyyy paraphrasing of your ev. i don't expect you to read card-text in all of your speeches (though that would be nice in constructive... sigh). but like... rly not a fan of debaters taking a quote from their evidence and putting their ""spin"" on what it says/arguing in the ""spirit of the ev""/doing the most with the ev because ""it technicallyyy says that""/anything that bastardizes the integrity of your representation of evidence. - do not take that to mean that i dislike analytics. on the contrary, i reward thoughtful, well-warranted analytics. but i punish analytics passed off as evidence. - defending any potential social prejudice that comes up in your args, attitude, treatment of opponents, etc. i don't just dislike this, i will tank your speaks and speak to your coach if necessary. - i am familiar with theory. lmk if you're unsure if you should run something in front of me. i will not BS you, if i cannot evaluate an arg / don't think it's likely i'd vote for it, i will 100% lyk. good rule of thumb is that you can run theory if you can effectively explain (i.e. warrant) your arg's necessity in the space, my role as a judge, your arg's role in education/accessibility/etc, and more. if your theory warranting is not up to par with substance warranting, you should probably stick to substance in front of me.

"LASA 20 Emory 24 I'd like to be on the email chain: meleckel[at]gmail[dot]com. 3 important things you should know: 1. The people that have most influenced how I judge debates are Yao Yao Chen and Mason Marriott-Voss. I tend to emulate them when deciding debates, so look to their paradigms for more clarity. 2. ""I am not persuaded by personal callouts or issues external to what occurs within the debate round I am judging."" - Catherine Haus. 3. Tech > Truth. This applies to me as well. This paradigm at times might read as if I have strong opinions, but I will put those aside and attempt to provide an objective, unbiased, decision. The following are just preferences, not rules I abide by. K Things: 1. Neg K v. Policy: A. I think the aff should get to weigh the aff and the neg gets links to the plan. B. Links to reps are OK but it's important you explain how the aff's representations produce XYZ impact. Too often, teams say ""Reps bad"" and say ""Extinction"" with zero connection or explanation. Just as the aff has defended an impact to their plan and not the entirety of policymaking, the negative must win an impact to the aff's reps, not the entire history of how those reps have been used. C. Links to fiat, scenario planning, and other nonsense that doesn't engage with the content of the aff are likely a non-starter.  2. Aff K v. Policy: A. I think fairness is an impact. Debate is an activity that is driven by competitive incentives with winners and losers. Most every decision we make in a round is shaped by the desire to gain a ballot. I think both sides, regardless of their argumentative preference, have voluntarily subscribed to this activity. Regardless of what model of debate is desirable, most everyone agrees that debate itself is desirable, to which fairness is a precursor. To beat fairness, the affirmative needs to forward a counter-interpretation that mitigates the risk of a predictable limits DA with an external impact that outweighs ""fair debate"". Impact calculus in these debates are very important. B. I'm not a fan of jargon. Too often teams say ""Neuroplasticity DA"" or ""Pathologization DA"" without an explanation of what this means. I am much more interested in the aff explaining their argument and how it interacts with the neg's offense than throwing words at me and hoping 1 sticks.  C. I'm not persuaded by the variant of arguments that say framework is violent.  "
"Blake '21, UChicago '25 Did PF on the nat circuit for 3 years and I am currently an Assistant Coach for Blake. Tl;dr: - Pls run paraphrasing theory - Send speech docs, its better for everyone - Strike me if you don't read cut cards/if you paraphrase or don't think evidence is important, you will be happy that you did. - I flow. - Tech>truth. - Paraphrasing is awful, evidence is VERY important to me and I am happy to use the ballot to punish bad ethics in round. - All kinds of speed are fine, spreading too as long as you are spreading long cards and not paraphrasing. - 2nd rebuttal must frontline, defense isnt sticky, and if I'm something is going to be mentioned on my ballot, it MUST be in both back half speeches. - Please weigh. - I will let your opponents take prep for as long as it takes for you to send your doc or cards without it counting towards their 3 minutes, so send docs pls and send them fast. - The following people have shaped how I view debate: Ale Perri (hi Ale), Christian Vasquez, Bryce Piotrowski, and Shane Stafford. - Basically, go to Zoe Spicer's paradigm and do the opposite of everything she says. Unfortunately for her, to find her debate takes, you need to get a time machine and go back to the Jurassic era because of how ancient they are, so it shouldn't be much of an issue. jenebo21@gmail.com AND blakedocs@googlegroups.com -- Put BOTH on the email chain and feel free to contact me after the round (on Facebook preferably, or email if you must) if you have questions or need anything from me. I am always happy to do what I can after the round to help you out. General Paradigm: - Full roadmaps in PF are stupid, just tell me where you're starting and then signpost - The Split: 2nd rebuttal must frontline, turns and defense - The Back Half: If I am going to vote on it, or if it is going to be apart of my RFD (all offense or defense in the round), it needs to be both in the summary and the final focus. None of this sticky defense nonsense. Weighing needs to start in summary, and final focus should be writing my ballot for me. - Speed: I can handle all speeds in PF. More often then not, clarity matters more than WPM, I know debaters who speak super fast and I can understand every word, and I know debaters who don't speak fast but are still super unclear, and vise versa. I will say clear if I cant follow. You can spread IF you are doing it like it is done in policy (spreading long cards, not a bunch of paraphrased garbage, slow down on tags/authors, sending out a speech doc is a must because I probably will miss things). IF you spread AND paraphrase, however, your chances of winning points of clash immediately plummet. - Pls send speech docs, I will probably ask for them so then I can read cards without having to call for a million different ones, and it shortens the amount of time taken for ev exchange by a million, so just pls send them. - Extensions: You need to warrant arguments when you extend them, I do not appreciate blippy extensions because you ran out of time, go for less and weigh it. It will be hard for me to evaluate a blippy extension, and I don't want to have to do that to make a decision. - Weighing: You need to weigh on both the link and impact level, very often the team that weighs will pick up my ballot. I don't hate buzzwords as much as other PF judges, but I do need an explanation. Please start weighing as early as possible, in the rebuttals if you can. Early weighing helps you make strategic decisions and makes my life easier since weighing is what guides my ballot. I will always prefer weighing done earlier and dropped, over late weighing so weigh early and often. The evaluation of the round on my ballot starts and ends with weighing and it controls where I look to vote. I don't need a story or a super clear narrative, but write my ballot for me and make it easy. - Collapse: PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE collapse, preferably starting in second rebuttal. This makes all of our lives easier because you don't want to have to spam buzzwords blippily in response to some poorly extended argument, and I don't want to sift through a flow with tons of tags and zero warrants or weighing. Pick an argument to go for, and weigh that argument. That is the easiest way to pick up my ballot. Debate isn't a scoreboard, winning 3 arguments doesn't mean you get my ballot if your opponent only wins 1 argument. - I cannot believe I have to make this apart of my paradigm, it should be exceedingly obvious, but no delinks or non-uniques on yourself (specifically that delinks the link you read in case or something which makes the opposite argument that you made initially) to get out of turn offense. It makes being first impossible and its just so stupid. I won't evaluate those arguments and your opponents are free to extend those turns. - On advocacies/T: This is something that should be resolved in the round and I will eval the flow if this argument is made but my personal thoughts are as follows - Because the neg doesn't get a CP in PF, the aff's advocacy does not block the neg out of ground (basically neither side gets to control the others ground). The aff does the whole aff, the neg can garner DAs off of the aff's advocacy or any interpretation of what the aff could look like, not just what that aff was in that round. An example would be the neg could still read a Russia provocation negative on the NATO topic (Septober 2021) even if the aff does not read a troop deployment advocacy for their advantages. Alternatively, if the neg can get a CP then I suppose the aff can get an advocacy. Either way works - point being that PF should add a plan/CP debate but thats for another day. - Be nice and respectful, but keep it light and casual if you can! Debate is fun, so lets treat it as such. - I will be quick to drop debaters and arguments that are any -ism, and I won't listen to arguments like racism good. The space first and foremost needs to be safe to participate in. - I don't care what you what you wear, where you sit, if you swear (sometimes a few F-bombs can make an exceedingly boring debate just a little less so!), etc. Evidence: I like cut cards and quality evidence, I hate paraphrasing. Disclaimer: this is going to seem cranky, but I don't mind well warranted analytics. I just hate paraphrasing. Ev is always better than an analytic, but if you introduce an arg as an analytic, I won't mind and will evaluate it as such. But if your opponents have evidence, you will likely lose that clash point. Here a few main points on evidence issues: - Evidence is the backbone of the activity, otherwise it devolves into some really garbage nonsense. As a result, debates about evidence are very easy ways to pick me up. Arguments about evidence preference are very good in front of me, and I will probably call for cards at the end of the round because most debate evidence is horrifically miscut or paraphrased. Evidence quality is very very important, and I have NO PROBLEM intervening against awful evidence especially in close rounds. Good evidence is important for education and quality of debate, so if you have bad evidence, I am happy to drop you for it to improve the activity and hopefully teach you a lesson. This applies to both if you cut cards or paraphrase, because cutting cards doesn't make you immune to lying about it, so generally cut good cards, and read good evidence. - Paraphrasing: The single biggest problematic content-related norm in debate today is paraphrasing. Its bad for the quality of debate, its bad for all of its educational benefits, and its unfair. I hate it so so much. So please cut cards, its not difficult and it makes everyone's lives better. That said, I know that it happens regardless so here are a few things important for the in round if you do paraphrase: a. PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE have a cut card or at least a paragraph, you absolutely need to be able to have this, its a rule now. Your opponents do not need to take prep to sort through your PDFs, and if you cant quickly produce the evidence and where you paraphrased it from, I'm crossing the argument off my flow. I have very little tolerance for long, paraphrased evidence exchanges where you claim to have correctly paraphrased 100 page PDFs and expect your opponents to be able to check against your bad evidence with the allotted prep time. b. If you paraphrase, you MUST be reading full arguments. 40 authors in 1st rebuttal by spreading tag blips and paraphrasing authors to make it faster is not acceptable and your speaks will tank. Claim, warrant, ev is all required if I am going to vote on it or even flow it. c. if you misrepresent a card while paraphrasing, not only is that bad in a vacuum, but I will give you the L25. If you realize its badly represented OR you cant find it when asked and you make the arg ""just evaluate as an analytic"" I will be PISSED and not only will I drop you but I will end the round early and give you lowest speaks I can give. Its a terrible, terrible argument, so please dont make it. If you introduce the evidence, you have to be able to defend it. d. Dont be mad at me if you get bad speaks. There is not a world in which someone who paraphrases even if they give the perfect speech gets above a 29 in front of me and to this day I have not given someone paraphrasing above a 28 so please, just dont. - Evidence exchange: if you cant produce a card upon being asked for it within a minute or two, at best you get lowest speaks I can give and probably the L too - Even if its not theory, arguments that I should prefer cut cards over paraphrased cards at the clash points are going to work in front of me. Please make those arguments, I think they are very true. - Another thing im shocked i have to put in my paradigm, but you need to cite the author you are reading even if you paraphrase from them, for it to be counted as evidence and not an analytic. if you read something without citing an author, I will flow it as an analytic and if your opponents call for that piece of ev, and you hand it to them without citing it in the round, I am dropping you. Its plagiarism and extremely unethical. This is an educational activity, come on ppl. Progressive paradigm: I'm receptive to all args, and I love the idea of progressive arguments in PF because it is about time that the community came around to allowing these types of arguments into the debate space. Used properly, they give a very good opportunity to making the debate space better, more inclusive and, more fair. Here are a few disclaimers for me personally: - While there are obvious upsides to progressive arguments, I don't appreciate frivolous theory (see below). This does include spikes and tricks, I don't like them, pls don't run them. If the theory is frivolous, and I reserve the right to determine that, I won't vote on it no matter the breakdown of the round. - I am personally biased and I will vote for arguments if I believe they make the debate space better. This is mostly true for paraphrasing bad, although I am also biased towards disclosure good. - I won't vote for auto-30 speaker point arguments Theory: - I probably default to competing interps unless told otherwise, but that doesn't really mean much if you read the rest of this paradigm. By that I mean this, I am going to eval the flow, so if you read theory arguments that I won't intervene against, I am going to eval it normally. - RVIs are dumb, you don't get to win for proving you are ethical. I suppose I can see myself voting for an RVI if someone horrifically mishandles it, but if theres warranted clash on the issue of RVIs, I generally think no-RVIs. - I have no problem intervening against frivolous theory (i.e. shoe theory), so if you run theory in front of me, please believe that its actually educational for the activity. Even theory like social distancing or contact info are ones where its hard to win in front of me, and in some contexts I probably won't vote on it. Resolved theory and other non-sense will barely warrant getting flowed for me, I won't vote on them. - Theory needs to be read in the speech following the violation. Out of round violations should be read in constructive. - Paraphrasing is bad: I will vote on paraphrasing bad most of the time, as long as theres some offense on the shell. I personally think its good for the debate space and am very predisposed to voting for it. I will NEVER vote on paraphrasing good, I don't care how mad that may make you to hear, I just won't do it. If you introduce cut cards bad or paraphrasing good as a new off I will instantly drop you. That said, you can win enough defense on a paraphrasing shell to make it not a voter. Paraphrasing theory is the exception to the disclaimers outlined above, I think paraphrasing should be punished in round and am happy to vote on it. IF YOU INITIATE PARA GOOD I WILL DROP YOU - Disclosure is good: I am less excited to hear it because typically, disclosure rounds are really bad and messy. Open source is good too, I have come around on it, so you can basically run whatever disclosure interp you want. Run it if you think you can win it, but dont be fearful to hear it ran against you in front of me. Respond to it, and I will vote as I would a normal flow (with a shade to disclosure good). - Trigger warnings: This theory has been read a lot more recently, I will eval it like a normal shell, but for the record, I think trigger warnings in PF are usually bad, and usually run on arguments that dont need to be trigger warned which just suppresses voices and arguments in the activity. You can go for the theory, but my threshold for responses will be in accordance with that belief typically. Kritiks/Arguments that people in PF are calling ""Kritiks"" even when they are not: - I am all good with kritiks, although im not as experienced with them as I am with other args, but that isnt a reason not to run a K in front of me. I will be able to flow it and vote on it as long as you explain it well. - Blake 2021 made me think about this a lot, and I think the activity is just going through growing pains that are necessary, but some of these debates were really bad. So please think through all of the arguments you read, so that you can articulate exactly what my ballot does or what specifically I am supposed to be doing. This means implicating responses or arguments onto the FW debate, or the ROTB. - Also, no one thinks fiat is real (pre/post-fiat is just an inaccurate and irrelevant label), so lets be more specific about how we label arguments or discourse. Make comparisons as to why your discourse or type of education is more important than theirs, this is not done by slapping the label ""pre-fiat"" onto an argument because NO ONE THINKS ITS REAL. Just get past that label and explain why. - You also need to do a pretty good amount of work explaining why or how discourse shapes reality, just asserting it does isn't much of a warrant and this debate is always underdeveloped in rounds I am in. - Any sort of IVI or something along those lines is fine, you just need to make the violation clear, and warrant why dropping them is important or does anything. Without that internal warranting, these debates are somewhat unproductive and kind of annoying. There are plenty of justifiable IVIs, just explain why they are and you should be fine. Speaks: I will probably give around a 27-28 in most rounds. I guess I give lower speaks than most PF judges, so I’ll clarify. 27-28 is middling to me with various degrees within that. 26-27 is bad, not always for ethical reasons. Below a 26 is an ethical issue. If you get above a 29 from me you should be very happy Bc I never give speaks that high almost ever. "
"2021-22 Paradigm  Put me on the email chain: keganferguson@gmail.com. PF Paradigm below policy Previously worked as the ADOD at North Broward Prep. Debated at Indiana University and Ben Davis High School in Indianapolis, IN. I’m usually coaching or assisting with some program on the side – so I’ll have a decent understanding of topic literature. I also worked as a political research consultant and have a public policy degree, so tend to follow the wonkish debates pretty well. Top of the paradigm is for Policy, with PF and LD afterward. Top-level: Debate is primarily a competition. It’s one that teaches us many values and influences how we develop as people, but is still a game with a winner and a loser at its core. That central truth produces debate’s best and worst outcomes. It can result in thorough, well-researched debates that delve into the nuances of a specific issue. Or it can produce scattershot 57-off strategies that rely on mistakes to have a chance of victory. I’ll evaluate both debates all the same, but enjoy one a whole lot more. That same truth can also make us view competitors with respect and admiration for their commitment to the activity. Or it can make us view them as our opposition, to be steamrolled and reduced to nothing whenever possible. I’ll evaluate the content of the arguments all the same if you’re rude and unkind to your competitors, but you’ll enjoy your speaker points a whole lot less. No argument is ‘too bad’ to win in front of me. If it’s truly so egregious, it’s the burden of the opposing team to explain why in the debate. I try hard not to intervene and inject personal biases, but I do still have them and they influence the decisions I make. That being said – I’m still an educator at the end of the day, and debate is an activity for students in an academic setting. If you are actively hostile and bigoted during the round towards your opponents or a group of people, you will lose for that reason. It's not too hard to get high speaks in front of me. Have a clear strategy, execute it well, and make the debate enjoyable for all involved. K AFFs I prefer critiques to include research about the topic, but it’s not required. Clear impact turns to the core negative standards on framework are vital – spewing nebulous and blippy arguments titled things like ‘Plasticity DA’ to T in the 2ac is terminally unpersuasive. If you’re not contextualizing your impact turns as direct answers to fairness, clash, etc. you’re in a hole from the start. Ideally, you will also present a straightforward and well explained vision of debate and develop reasons why it can preserve a limited argumentative venue. I’m more persuaded by presumption arguments vs. K affs than most judges. 2AR’s tend to mishandle offensive, cruel optimism-style arguments and get themselves into trouble. T USFG You need to explain how the aff’s C/I explodes limits and to what extent, same as you would against a policy affirmative when going for T. What style affirmative does it allow for? Why is it bad for debate, and how bad? When I vote affirmative it’s usually because of a sequencing claim about dropped case arguments or an unclear response to the aff’s impact turns to framework impacts. When I vote negative it’s usually because you win fairness is a priori and the only thing the ballot can resolve, that a limited model of debate internal link turns aff impacts through improved research/iterative testing, or that the Aff’s scholarship is included in your model. iS fAirNesS aN inTernAL LiNK oR iMpaCT? Both. I don't care. Theory Not a fan of heavy theory debates, but I’ve judged quite a few. Definitely lean neg on conditionality – but willing to vote for it if competently extended and technically won by the affirmative. As a 2a, process counterplans were not my favorite argument in debate, and I tend to lean aff on competition arguments here. That being said, the topic is massive and there’s a ridiculous amount of affirmative ground – which does make me sympathetic to neg claims about their centrality + importance. Still not afraid to vote neg quickly and easily if you’re ahead on the technical aspects in this portion of debate. Theory debates that rely on me to fill-in arguments where you have just said random technical debate jargon - nonstarter. You should slow down on your theory analytics as well – I often find myself missing nuance when it’s extended by reading blocks as fast as possible. *** Public Forum Debate *** I competed in Indiana in high school, and very much understand the frustrations of losing debates on new arguments, evidence spin, ‘I just don’t believe you,’ etc. in front of lay judges. I’ll try my hardest to purely evaluate the debate off of the flow, which means giving equal weight and consideration to arguments that are not traditionally made in Public Forum. I think judges should approach debate with an open mind, and be ready to listen to students who put just as much effort and thought into their non-traditional strategies as other teams have. Indicating an openness to theoretical and critical arguments does not mean that you should necessarily try reading these arguments in front of me for the first time. I find myself judging very poorly executed strategies in these lanes pretty often, and the speaker points reflect it. Please stick with what you’ve been practicing, as this is the best way to win my ballot. Trying to punk another team on theory if you never go for it will usually not work out well for you. Competing in policy for 4 years in college has left me with many, somewhat negative, opinions on the pedagogical quality of argumentation in PF. Research is often not presented to me in a clear and digestible way (read: cards), and I’ve been handed a 20+ PDF as the ‘source’ for an argument too many times to count. Saying ‘nuclear war doesn’t happen, MAD checks that’s Ferguson,’ and then handing me a piece of evidence with 2 minutes of highlighted text will not go your way. I won’t read deep into evidence that has not been explained and warranted during the debate, as I think that leads to pretty sizable judge intervention and more arbitrary decisions than one that remains flow-centric. I’m a big advocate of disclosure in PF. The best debates are ones where one team has a thoroughly prepared strategies against a case, and the other team really knows the ins and outs of their own contentions. I’m not sympathetic at all to arguments about prep-outs – I’m terminally convinced that they’re good. I’m not convinced by arguments about how they hurt small schools – I competed at a very tiny college program that ONLY survived because of the wiki. I’m not sympathetic to arguments about people ‘stealing research,’ because it’s obviously not ‘stealing’ and lazy debaters that download wiki cases usually get beaten because they don’t know the nuances of the arguments they’re reading. If you disclose on the wiki, you will get a slight speaker bump. If you disclose pre-round, same deal. Note: this does not mean that disclosure theory is an auto-win by any means. You will have to technically execute it and win that disclosure is good during the debate – I won’t copy and paste my paradigm into the ballot. Nitpicky other thoughts that may be helpful: · Don’t take forever finding your evidence – especially if it’s in your own case. If it drags on too long (3-4 minutes) I will begin to run prep time. There’s clearly a reasonable window of time in which you can find a piece of evidence you claimed to have literally just read. If you can’t find it, you probably didn’t actually cut/read it. · Don’t ever go back to your own case in first rebuttal just to ‘build it up some more.’ I will not be flowing if you are not making new arguments, and it’s a complete waste of time to rebuild a case they have not yet answered. There are some exceptions to this if you have framing arguments or whatnot – but 99% of the time you should just be answering your opponent’s case. To me, it reads as a clear sign that someone is a relative beginner in Public Forum when this occurs. · Second rebuttal should frontline their case. · Summary should include defensive and dropped arguments, but time should be allocated according to the other teams’ coverage. · Impact framing arguments that are simply ‘X issue is not discussed enough, so prioritize it’ are not convincing to me in the slightest. You need to have a clear and offensive reason why not prioritizing your impact filter is bad, not just say that it’s important and people never give it notice. Ask yourself this question: what is the impact of your framing being ignored? · Warrants beat tagline extensions of cards 99% of the time. None of the above are ‘rules’ for how to go about earning my ballot. You could violate any one of the above and still win, but it’s likely only going to happen if your opponent is making major mistakes. Lastly, I think that topic knowledge wins just as many debates as a cleverly constructed case does. You should try your best to be the most knowledgeable person in the room on any given PF topic, because you’ll usually have what it takes to flexibly respond to unpredicted arguments and embarrass your opponents in cross. **** Lincoln Douglas **** Not gonna lie - much of the current state of this activity annoys me. An overreliance on missed tricks, opponents misunderstanding nonsensical K's, and underdevelopment of most arguments in the round seem to be how the LD rounds I judge go. I guess I'm a great judge for the activity since I flow and can keep up with speed pretty easily, but your speaks are going to suffer if what I described above is your primary strategy in the debate. I prefer smart, nuanced arguments that are developed well throughout the debate, not 7-off with 4 theory shells sprinkled throughout the speech. Very open to and aware of most K literature - but be cautious of reading multiple K's or a K + DA strategy that contain clearly contradictory arguments. I'm not a big fan of perf con in LD, since I think the limited time window in the 1ar makes it pretty abusive for the aff to actually grapple with. I'm not going to be familiar with the super in-the-weeds K or theory argument that is only a thing in LD. I come from Policy/PF world, and you should debate with this in mind. Speaker point scale: 29.5+ - You’re debating like you’re already in the final round, and you deserve top speaker at this tournament. 29-29.5 – Debating like a quarterfinalist. 28.5 – 29 – Solid bubble/doubles team 28-28.5 – Debating like you should be around .500 or slightly below 27.5-28 – Serious room for improvement Below 27.5 – You were disrespectful to the extreme or cheated. Probably around here if you just give up as well. "
"I debated Public Forum for 4 years during high school in the Dominican Republic, during which I became the International TOC 2018 Champion. Currently, I am a debate coach for several Dominican schools. In general, I judge rounds based on argumentation and flow. You are allowed to speak as fast as you want, as long as you are understandable while doing so, with the caveat that I am exceptionally bad at understanding spreading. I am pretty knowledgeable in debate jargon, so don't be afraid to get technical. Good teamwork and speaking skills are appreciated, as well. In the end, my decision will probably boil down to the best use of arguments and impacts in the round (though this is TBD for specific rounds). Be sure to extend your arguments into summary AND final focus if you want me to include them in my decision process (too many teams have lost rounds because they drop huge arguments in the later speeches). Anything mentioned in crossfire that is NOT mentioned in a future speech is not going to be factored into my decision. Signposting is very important so that I can maintain a good understanding of what you are responding to. I can usually figure out what you are talking about, but it's best to use this technique to avoid confusion. The same goes for general organization – try to keep a good order so I can flow with you, not against you. If you want to use pre-speech roadmaps, the decision to use them or not is up to you. My biggest debate pet peeves are extensions through ink. If you do not frontline your arguments, you are not winning that argument, no matter how short or nonsensical their response was. For second-speaking teams, I'd rather they do their frontlining in their rebuttal. This gives the first-speaking team a fairer chance to provide proper defense in summary. This should go without saying, but you need to be thorough in rebuttal by answering to their WHOLE speech. Any new responses you bring up in summary, grand cross, or final focus that were not present in rebuttal (unless they are frontlines, of course) will not be factored into my decision. Also, if there is a direct evidence or argument clash, you need to actually bring something new to the table. Analyze and compare evidence or arguments, don't just say what your own argument or evidence says; otherwise, the argument will be a wash and I will not factor it in my decision. Be sure to weigh your impacts with your opponents' so the impact calculus doesn't fall under my (probably biased) burden. I cannot stress this point enough: so many rounds have been lost simply because I had to be the one doing the impact calculus. So be clear on why and how your impact outweighs your opponents'. However, before considering any impact weighing, make sure you actually access those impacts. There is no use comparing an impact that was shut down in rebuttal or summary. Additionally, keeping a clear, concise narrative and explaining your logic and link chain throughout the debate is probably the most important thing you need to do in the later speeches. I am very unfamiliar with Ks and Theory, so if you are inclined to use them, be very clear on them. The same goes for convoluted or extremely unique arguments. However, if your argument is purposefully confusing to disorient the opposing team, you're not doing a great job with your speech. If I'm unable to understand your point or central argument, you are unlikely to win the round. Remember: debate is about having fun! "
"Short Version I have ten+ years of debate experience and will buy any argument, as long as it is well structured and fair. I am known to be a very progressive judge in Wisconsin, however on Nat circuit level it might be better to treat me as a Flay judge. I do love a good traditional debate, but do like progressive debate. Most importantly have fun in a round! Long version  Event Preferences  PF: Tech>truth within reason. speed>collapsing: Share a doc and go for everything, yes even if that means spreading. I generally HATE time suck contentions, like don't waste my time flowing something you know you are going to drop. Provide more education to the round by running quality arguments, or end your speech early. full case>paraphrasing: In general the more you can take the good file sharing habits of LD and CX and use them, the quick and better the round will go. LD: LARP (Policy-style arguments i.e. Plans, CPs, Disads, Topicality) > Trad/Phil (Standard LD case) > Ks/Performance > Theory > Tricks> Disclosure Theory CX Neg: Disads>T>Specs>CP>K>Theory > Tricks> Disclosure Theory CX Aff: traditional cases>aff Ks>Disclosure Theory Thoughts on certain topics  Framework: Please tell me how the framework contextualizes your offense / defense in relation to the ballot and/or the round. I require framework to also contextualize how your opponents arguments are implicated by your Framework arguments. Argument Resolution: I reward debaters who clearly articulate and provide reasons why their warrants, impacts, sources are stronger in this round – Impact calc and voters are great ways to do this. Debaters who provide well warranted arguments on the flow that are developed early and throughout the debate get both high speaks from me and my ballot. Theory: I vote on well developed procedurals, I do not vote on blipped shells that blow up later in the debate so have voters and standards don’t just give me an interp and violation - this isn't to say don't run T in front of me but rather that you need to provide me a well developed justification for why to prefer your side. Focus on impacts through a education/fairness filter will be the easiest way to my ballot on this issue. I do hate it when teams use theory as a time suck. K debate: I have read and actively coach a lot of critical debate but you should not however assume I know the literature base you will be pulling from, feel free to ask prior to the start of the round about my familiarity. The more specific your argument is to the round or issue at hand then the easier route you will have to my ballot. I usually am not a fan of Perm because it can make the debate muddy. I do love conditionality debate. Tricks: If is one thing you should not run with me, it is tricks, I like a clean and fair Debate. Disadvantages: Disads are my favorite off case argument. I evaluate Disads first on the risk of intrinsic link to the AFF before questions of uniqueness and the way this implicates the affirmative, this isn't to say questions of uniqueness don't implicate the link but questions of link comes first and then are determined to be strengthened / weakened by the uniqueness. - Work done on the impact level to have strong warrants as well as good weighing are an easy way to my ballot. Counter Plan: My second favorite off case argument to see. Make sure they are mutually exclusive and AFF can’t perm. Also I hate Perm debate usually on CP because it is either an easy win or waste of my time. I think overall Cp play well with Disads and are a easy way for NEG to win my ballot. Speed: I am perfectly fine with speed usually I will only yell clear once and it is because you are not speaking clearly.DO NOT SPREAD ANALYTICS WITHOUT A DOC. Flashing: Add me to the email chain, my RFD will be better if you do. justinflynn190@gmail.com "
"I'll vote off of anything that isn't offensive, but I have barely ever judged. So go slow, explain things very clearly, and assume I know 0 jargon or anything about the topic. "
"FOR PF: I am unfamiliar with many of the intricacies and norms of PF debate, so I primarily will vote on persuasion. Please make your arguments clear and persuasive! Thank you :). FOR LD: add me to the email chain - please have it set up before round: JFGeorges21@mail.strakejesuit.org I debated for Strake Jesuit College Preparatory and I graduated class of 2021. I qualled to TOC twice, got to octas junior year, and I had 13 career bids. Judge instruction is very good. i evaluate the flow, but it'll be easier for you to get high speaks if you make it easy on me Signpost - it's easiest for me to flow top down when I'm judging, but that doesn't really work if i don't know what argument you're answering/addressing. I think I'm pretty good with speed, but if you're unclear, I will say clear one time. After that I will stop and dock speaks. That being said, please don't get upset if I didn't vote on an argument when I literally say clear 3 times and don't understand a thing you're saying. I will not vote on an argument I don't understand or didn't hear in the initial speech obviously, so even if you're crushing it on the flow, make sure you're flowable and explain things well. Prep time ends when you're done prepping, you don't need to take prep to send out the doc on email, but you do for compiling a doc. I will vote on non T positions, just tell me why I should and explain the ballot story. NOTE: IF YOU'RE GIVING A 2AR VERSUS T OR THEORY, EXTEND CASE. I will negate on presumption if it's just a 3 minute PICs 2AR with nothing on case AGAINST NOVICES/NON-PROGRESSIVE DEBATERS: If this is a bid tournament, literally just don't be rude. You can read whatever position you want, but if you don't spread and read like a good phil NC or something so the round is educational even tho you're crushing them, you'll get good speaks. otherwise, read whatever you want idc ill give u normal speaks, just try to make the round educational. only time i will rly have to dock ur speaks is if you're being outwardly mean. if it's elims, do whatever you need to win. Don't steal prep or miscut. u can call ev ethics by staking the round or reading it as a shell/making it an in round argument - whatever u want. no takebacks if u stake the round tho. I absolutely hate judging LARP versus LARP debates. Take that as you will. Non-negotiables: One winner and one loser (unless there's like an extreme circumstance) Normal speech times - 6-3-7-3-4-6-3 Defaults: ~I can be convinced to go the other way very easily. Procedurals (like disclosure) > T and other theory T > Theory 1AR theory > 1NC theory/2NR theory Fairness over education (If you didn't read them as voters, then neither will be evaluated obviously, unless nobody points it out, and you both debate under the assumption that they're voters) DTA unless it's like a spec shell or something that is irreversible, then DTD. Competing Interps No RVI No judgekick Truth testing Here's some in depth on certain styles of debate: LARP Just weigh, you can read whatever. I do not judgekick unless you tell me to, and I will not kick it otherwise unless you tell me you're kicking it. Like literally just either justify judgekick and move on, or tell me you're kicking it, it's not that hard Theory If you do high quality weighing and make it clean - you'll get good speaks. However, if you're going for reasonability, MAKE SURE YOU READ A BRIGHTLINE. Competing interps vs. Reasonability is a debate to be had, but if you don't read a brightline, I will probably be more compelled to use competing interps. Also, I vote on friv theory and won't lower your speaks 99% of the time. PLEASE though, don't make me have to judge a messy theory debate, just weigh well and make it clean. I hate having to resolve messy theory debates. WEIGH STANDARDS. K I'm more familiar with these authors/kritiks as read in debate (in no particular order): Afro Pessimism (Wilderson, Warren, Sharpe, Sexton) Queer Pessimism (Stanley, Edelman, baedan) Weheliye, Deleuze, Guattari, Bataille, Baudrillard, Berardi, Lacan, Disability (Mollow, Hughes, St. Pierre, Selck, Campbell) Settler Colonialism (Tuck, Yang, Rifkin, Grande, etc.) Ecofeminism, Marx, Derrida. You still need to warrant and explain your arguments very well. I will not use prior knowledge to fill in gaps for you. That being said, those are the fields in which I'm the most comfortable, but I will still vote on anything else as long as it's explained and warranted. I like K tricks like VTL and floating PIKs so if you execute them well, you'll get good speaks. long K overviews are good if it's like rly complicated, but otherwise, it shouldn't be too long. Alt solves case args are good. Make them as specific to the aff as possible, and I am very persuaded by tricky alt solves case args. Also, please hint at floating PIKs in the 1NC, it will make me more inclined to vote on it. Note: If you don't tell me you're kicking the alt, I will assume you are going for it. Phil I'm pretty familiar with most frameworks that people are reading today, but I still need a very clear explanation if you're going into something very dense. I've read Util, Kant, Hobbes, Levinas, Testimonies, Gauthier, GCB, Aquinas, Enoch, Deleuze, Intuitionism, Hill, International Law, Virtue Ethics, Polls, Pettit, Proceduralism, etc. so these are ones I'm very familiar with. I don't have a preference of syllogistic phil vs. framework with a bunch of independent warrants, just make good arguments please. Hijacks on case are good. Smart permissibility triggers are good. yeah. contingent standards are interesting - if you execute it will, i will be impressed. not gonna hack for it, but if you win on a Christianity aff/NC, you will likely get good speaks. HOWEVER, if you answer CX questions incorrectly, i'll just know you're doing it for this purpose, and I will NOT be boosting your speaks. if it's like way off, i'll prob dock ur speaks. Tricks ill vote on tricks and i like it when theyre interesting. generally theyre not that interesting though. to clarify, i am fine for tricks i dont doc speaks or anything but dont make it messy because then i will. I like eval after a certain speech args tho. "
"email me for questions/add me to the chain: tara.gill.527@gmail.com tl;dr: Me: ""Do you know why I'm such a laid-back judge?"" Y'all: ""Why?"" Me: ""I go with the flow"" (creds to @Debate Memes on Facebook haha) - yes I will vote off the flow - warrant, extend your full link story and impact, and weigh and you're doing really well - things you want me to vote on have to be in every speech after first rebuttal - I want the round to be chill and educational and fun so please make that happen quick disclaimers 1. i'm now old and grumpy and care a bit less about debate than i used to so please don't assume i have extensive topic knowledge 2. January 2022 i hate this topic so much i'm down to judge a crypto debate or any other topic both teams agree on. if y'all want to debate this topic it's okay i won't be too mad :) novices: it's so cool that you're trying out this activity even though it's probably kind of scary. If you don't understand some of my preferences in the long version, the tl;dr should be fine. Just know that you're probably doing great and that you got this :) feel free to ask me any questions before/after the round. Longer Version: hi! I did 2 years of Public Forum at Lexington but I started out my debate career in policy which influences how I judge! - i'm more tech than the average tech judge so please clash to avoid judge intervention, or at the very least weigh a lot on both link and impact levels :) - in later speeches, please give quick narrative style overviews at the top of your own case then frontline/line by line (i still don't know what frontline means but just don't drop stuff) if u want me to vote on your contentions otherwise dropped defense will mitigate your impacts. this also means u should frontline in second rebuttal and extend defense in first summary. - i will vote off most arguments including theory/k if they are debated well (my threshold for these being run well is pretty high lmao so try at your risk ig) and not used just to be exclusionary (check the bottom of my paradigm lol) - do a lot of weighing/impact calc and logical analysis (not just for me, it is also strategic if you're lost/confused and I would know first hand oops) - once again please weigh weigh weigh. really make the force of gravity a lot here (i'm sorry i'm a physics nerd) - start collapsing in first summary because depth>breadth in terms of giving quality arguments in short PF speech times - crossfire shouldn't be three minutes of extra debating please ask and answer questions in a non-aggressive and CIVIL manner or I will be frustrated, get a headache and probably dock speaks. - if you want to take off a jacket or shoes in round feel free to do so because i almost never debate with shoes. this will not affect speaks or the result :) - feel free to ask me questions about my decision if you're confused, I will not dock speaks and I feel like it usually helps you learn how you can improve in the future, and there is a non-zero probability I am wrong (but low probability) - i am fine w speed if you do all of the following: prioritize clarity, make sure your opponents are ok too, slow down on tags, authors, and analytics, signpost clearly, offer speech docs if necessary - lastly, debate is a game: this means that you should not be exclusionary, follow the rules or warrant why you shouldn't, and let me know if there is anything I can personally do to make the debate more accessible to you, and HAVE FUN!!!!! Extra: - fist-bump instead of shaking hands haha - I'll default to a slightly above a 28 if it's by 0.1 and 28.5 if it's by 0.5 - i am also happy to talk after round, show you my flows, and answer questions about either debate or life :) "
"I coach for the College Preparatory School. I debated for two years for Bethesda-Chevy Chase HS. In my senior year I won Glenbrooks, the Strake Round Robin, Blake, Durham, the Barkley Forum, Stanford, Harvard, the King Round Robin, and NDCAs. Add eli.glickman@berkeley.edu AND collegeprepdocs@gmail.com to the email chain. Please label email chains properly. Ex. ""TOC R1 F1 Email Chain Bethesda-Chevy Chase GT v. AandM Consolidated DS."" UPDATE FOR THE REST OF THE SEASON: I will be requiring all debaters to send the cut cards and paraphrased versions (if they exist) of their constructive speeches in the email chain before the speech in which they are read. That means case and rebuttal. TL;DR Tech>truth. Weigh, give me good warranting, and speak as fast as you want. Defense is sticky; first FF may read some new weighing (NOT elaborate weighing… no overviews, prereq analysis, etc.). Extend your arguments with card names, warrants, links, and impacts in the back half. Weigh links and turns, defense, and pretty much everything else. Please read the evidence section of my paradigm and abide by those rules, they will be enforced. DEBATE IS A GAME, PLAY TO WIN. Tech>truth. I will vote for pretty much any argument as long as it's warranted well and it's not racist, antisemitic, sexist, homophobic, etc. I have experience with traditional and progressive. I will vote on the flow. How I Judge: If my paradigm is unclear, my favorite judges were Will Sjostrom, Chad Meadows and Marcus Ellinas; anything PF-specific in their paradigms should give you a fairly good idea of how I hope to evaluate the round. ———PART I: SPEECHES——— Signposting: This is essential; do it. Cross: I might listen but I won't vote off or remember anything said here unless it's in a speech. Don't be rude. Feel free to skip GCX if everyone agrees—both teams get 1min of prep. Rebuttal: Read as much offense/DAs as you want, just please implicate them on the line-by-line and weigh them. Second rebuttal MUST frontline terminal defense and turns, probably some defense too, but blippy NLs from the first rebuttal don't all need to be answered here. Summary: First summary only needs to extend turns but should also extend terminal defense if you have time. Defense is sticky, however, I’d prefer for the second summary to extend as much defense as possible. The only new turns or defense I’ll evaluate in summary are as responsive to new implications made by the other team. Final Focus: First final can do new weighing but no new implications of turns, or anything else UNLESS responding to new implications or turns from the second summary. Second final cannot do new weighing or new implications. Final focus is a really good time to slow down, treat me like a flay judge in these speeches and my decision becomes a lot easier. ———PART II: TECHNICAL STUFF——— DO NOT SAY 'DELINK,' SAY 'NO LINK.' Voting: I default to util. If there's no offense I presume to the first speaking team. I will always disclose after the round. I can also disclose speaks if you ask. Evidence: —Evidence §1— I will not accept paraphrased evidence. I treat paraphrased cards as equal in link strength to analytics. (You can make a theory argument as to why I shouldn't). If there are two pieces of competing evidence that will determine the round and both teams want me to look at it... I will almost always err on the side of the non-paraphrased evidence. Whether or not you paraphrase, YOU MUST have cut cards, if you don't I will cap your speaks at 27 and you should strike me (27 speaks cap does not apply for MSPF, NPF or JVPF). —Evidence §2— When evidence is called for, take less than 2 minutes to pull up the cards or it comes out of your prep. —Evidence §3— If you misconstrue evidence—you know who you are—and I find out, I will either drop you or give you the lowest possible speaks, depending on the severity of the misconstruction (I am more than willing to assign an L20 or below). If you catch your opponents misconstruing evidence, call it an independent voting issue (IVI) and I will treat this as a pre-fiat round-ending argument if the evidence is sufficiently misconstrued. Email Chains: Please label email chains adequately. Ex. ""TOC R1F1 Email Chain Bethesda-Chevy Chase GT v. AandM Consolidated DS."" Whether or not the tournament is online I will require an email chain for every round, evidence exchange is faster and more efficient. If you are spreading or reading any progressive argument you must send a doc before you begin; otherwise, sending a doc will not be required. Prep Time: Don't steal prep or I will steal your speaks. Feel free to take prep whenever, flex prep is fine too. Speech Times: These are non-negotiable. I stop flowing after the time ends, and I reserve the right to scream ""TIME"" if you begin to go over. Cross ends at 3 minutes sharp, if you’re in the middle of a sentence, finish it quickly. Speed: I can follow speed (300wpm+) but be clear, if I can't understand what you're saying that means I can't flow it. I'd like a speech doc if you're going to go over 275 words per minute. Speed is good in the first half and bad in the second half, collapse strategically; don't go for everything. If you spread (300+ wpm) paraphrased cards there is no way you get above 27 speaks. If I miss something in summary or final focus because you're going too fast and I drop you it's your fault; slow down, don't go for everything, and be efficient. Disclosure: If you've disclosed on the NDCA PF wiki properly I will give you +0.5 speaks, there's no punishment for not disclosing. Let me know if you are disclosed before the round so I can boost your speaks. (How to disclose.) Disclosure should include round reports and open source documents (I believe that disclosing highlights is bad, I will not increase speaks or look more favorably on highlights having been disclosed). Speaks: Clarity and strategy determine your speaks. I disclose speaks as well, just ask. Postrounding: Postround as hard as you want, I think it's educational. Before you start make sure I've submitted your speaks. Trigger Warnings: I do not require trigger warnings. I will not reward including them, nor will I penalize the absence of them. This is informed by my personal views on trigger warnings (see J. Haidt and G. Lukianoff, The Coddling of the American Mind) This means that I will never opt out of an argument. I will not hack for trigger warning good theory; I am open to trigger warning bad arguments (though I will not hack for these either). ———PART III: PROGRESSIVE DEBATE——— I enjoy theory debate; I ran theory frequently. You do not need to ask your opponent if they are comfortable with theory; 'I don't know how to respond' is not a sufficient response. To quote my partner Roy Tiefer, ""don't put your kids in varsity if they cannot handle varsity arguments"" (saying that is terminal defense against any 'idk how to respond' argument and will result in a 30 for whoever says it). Preferences: Theory/T - 1 LARP - 1 Kritik - 3 Tricks - 3 High Theory - 4 Non-T Kritik - 5 (Strike) Performance - 5 (Strike) Theory: Yes, I think paraphrasing is bad and disclosure is good. No, I will not hack for either of these shells. I really like theory. I think frivolous theory is bad but I'll evaluate it; I have a lower threshold for responses the more frivolous the shell. Poorly executed theory will result in low speaks. If you've never run theory before, and feel inclined to do so, I'm happy to give comments and help as much as I can. I default to competing interps and no RVIs. I believe that winning no RVIs applies to the entire theory layer unless your warrants are specific to a shell, C/I, etc. Non-friv theory should be a zero risk issue to check abuse, I will still vote for RVIs if you win them. Unless I am evaluating the theory debate on reasonability you must read a counterinterp... if you do not all of your responses are inherently defensive because your opponents are the only team providing me with a 'good' model of debate. Theory should be read immediately after the violation. Eg. if you're speaking first disclosure must be in your constructive for me to evaluate it. However, I am willing to vote off of paraphrasing theory read after rebuttal if your interpretation is that people shouldn't paraphrase in rebuttal. You MUST need to extend your own shell in rebuttal if it was read in 1st constructive; you must frontline your opponent's shell in the speech after it was read (unless there is a theoretical justification for not doing this). Kritiks: I have run Ks a few times, however, I am not the best judge for these rounds. I'm more familiar with biopower, security, cap, and imperialism than anything else. You can run high theory Ks just explain them well, I've read some of the literature in school. Tricks: These are pretty stupid but go for them if you want to. Everything Else: Framework, soft-left Ks, CPs, and DAs are fine. TKO: If your opponent has no path to the ballot (conceded theory shell or them reading a counterinterp that they do not meet themselves) invoke a TKO and you win with 30 speaks (unless you have violated any previous clauses related to speaker points), if they did have a path to the ballot you lose with 21s.

"No Debate. Firstly, If both teams agree, give me a paradigm that you like better and I'll judge based on it (this includes not flowing/being a lay judge lol I am g-d tier mom judge and won't intervene) Here is how you should read my paradigm: at the top of each section is the most important stuff. If you only have a few mins read that. reading below those parts will provide a more in-depth take into my judging philosophy. Update for Online Tourneys I rlly can't follow like REAL spreading but I can take 99% of PF speed. I'll clear u if i need it. also ask questions if u have them and I'll answer as honestly as possible! Most important part of my paradigm: If you make or buy me a chicken parm or mac and cheese, I will get you prep on a topic or coach you for a round or something. I rlly like chicken parm and mac and cheese.... My name is Sam and I debated PF at Wayland High School in Wayland, MA. Was a meh first speaker and got carried imo. Now I'm a member of the Barkley Forum at Emory University in Atlanta. TLDR: Normal circuit tech judge who likes warrants and logic and needs you to collapse on args Feel free to ask any questions about my paradigm before round or my RFD after round. (thx @Kate Selig for this idea: I'd rather you postround me than tell everyone I'm a bad judge ) Also, ask questions before the round starts! I might have thoughts on the topic you'll wanna hear. tbh also might not cuz I'm kinda dumb Speed: u can go fast, but don't like SPREAD SPREAD plz plz. i will try to keep up and clear u if need be. I can flow it but only if you articulate well enough. 300 wpm and up I need a speech doc. The faster you go the more work I have to do and I'm lazy. I will always flow ur speed, but chances are if you feel the need to go too fast, then your time allocation was bad/you made bad strategic decisions. Also like fr just cuz u can go fast doesn't mean u should. Speed kills Theory/Progressive args: read whatever you want. i ran a cap k during medicare for all and loved it lol. I'd rather you not read random theory args just bc you want to win. if you're doing that, ASK YOUR OPPONENTS/DISCLOSE BEFORE ROUND. its rlly shitty if you don't. i can't emphasize it enough, reading theory on novices or people that don't understand what's going on = :( If it's warranted and weighed I'll vote off of it. the below is borrowed from Jason Luo's paradigm d-d-d-d-disclosure theory - win the flow, win the round. i am very (like actually completely 50-50) tab ras about disclosure, i do not think it is good or bad, just that it exists. p-p-p-p-paraphrase theory - win the flow, win the round. i am very slightly biased (55-45) for paraphrasing good but its not hard to win paraphrasing bad. all other theory/k stuff: if it's warranted and weighed I'll vote off of it. Cross: it doesn't matter Its useless to me. If you want to use an answer your opponent gives in cross, then say it in a speech. Don't be rude. Hug your opponent for a 30. If your partner roasts their opponent in cross (without being douchey) you are expected to stand up and yell ""WORLD STAR!."" If you do so and I find the roast amusing then you and your partner each get 30's. If you misjudge a roast and I think it's lame you get 26's for interrupting cross. Framework: I default util. Explain it well and how I'm supposed to evaluate offense under it. the more complex, the more explaining u need. Framework debates aren't my absolute favorite but hey, you do you!! Evidence disputes: read ev if u want. don't miscut but i won't drop u for it. I value all evidence equally unless you weigh it, which you should. You should ALWAYS tell me why I need to value your evidence more. also, evidence doesn't matter nearly as much as logical warranting. also like in general i won't call for cards unless ur like ""sam call for this card"" in speech. I think that calling for ev in any other circumstance is intervening. Speaker Points: strategy + speak pretty to get good speaks You will get better speaks if: You make jokes. You give good speeches and make good strategic decisions. You aren't a dick. You make me laugh. I am extremely generous and tend to give out 29's routinely. I will give you a 30 if you are exceptional. *Send me a speech doc for an extra .3 speaks (sgoldstone514@gmail.com). Also extra .3 speaks for collapsing (if u do it correctly and it makes me happy) in 2nd rebutal. I guess I'm receptive to 30s theory but like it shouldn't be hard to get a 29.5 from me. I good example of really good strategy is what Jason Luo did in first final focus of TOC finals. also i will give speaks relative to the round and the level of competitors in the debate. Here is an itemized list of my favorite speakers in no particular order: - Rahul Shah (his voice is soothing and he's so damn cute) - Claudia Leduc (gives summary without looking at the flow at all, hella impressive) - Atharva Weling (sounds so persuasive) Rebuttal: collapse in 2nd rebuttal. at least frontline offense and stuff. anything not frontlined is conceded. Summary + FF: Collapse, extend full link chain, weigh I like roadmaps. I don't need defense in first summary. Don't extend too much in Summary, thats my biggest pet peeve FOR JESUS' (or any g-d u may or may not believe in, but if u wanna win the round do this lol) SAKE: COLLAPSE. When extending the argument you're going for, please extend the uniqueness, link, and impact in both speeches. An incomplete/ghost extension would a) make me sad and b) possibly lose you the round. Please impact out turns in summary (although its better if this is done in rebuttal) if you plan on going for them. It is 100% okay to just go for a dropped turn. Also, u can go either line by line or give voters/do what you usually do. Don't extend through ink lol. Defense isn't rlly sticky it (unless u make an arg that it is in speech) but I'm less inclined to vote for a team that doesn't frontline at all even if their opponents don't extend defense. Weighing: Please weigh, and give me good analysis. It makes my job 1000x easier. Earlier you weigh, the better. Weighing is very helpful in rebuttal, but NEEDED for me to vote in Summary and FF. With the new 3 min summaries, I see no reason why you shouldn't be able to weigh in summary. No new weighing in 2nd FF, new weighing in 1st FF is unfavorable but if it's the only weighing in the round and they don't respond to it then like eh. If both teams win their weighing and cases and there is no meta weighing then I will vote for the team whose weighing was introduced earlier in the round (prereq/link ins weighing doesn't apply here bc if one case is a prereq to another then u vote for the prereq/link in). Does this favor the 1st speaking team? No, you can weigh (and do other fun things) in 2nd constructive. Unrelated but remember to weigh turns over contentions. If nobody weighs then i honestly won't know what to do. I thinks its probably interventionist to pick which argument is better if both teams win their args. jUsT mAk3 mY lyfE eAs1eR!!! How I make my decision: Weighing debate first. I vote on the weighed args first but if nobody weighs then i be big sad, but I'll vote on cleanest/clearest path to the ballot. I thinks its probably interventionist to pick which argument is better if both teams win their args and the paths are both clear/clean. If there is no offense in the round then I flip a coin to decide who picks up cuz choosing any other way is interventionist, but feel free to make warranted arguments abt defaulting to one side or speaking order. I will always disclose after the round and give an RFD. also PS lmfao u need to win the link into the impact that u weighed.  Other: I will reward you for taking risks like collapsing on only a turn. Please signpost and tell me where you are on the flow. I hate dumb analogies, chances are, even if you think you're funny, you're not. Don’t call me judge, that’s weird. If a tournament is side-locked, if both teams agree to flip a coin the normal way (winner of the toss decides speaking order or side (their choice), the other team decides the other), I'm fine with that. I think side-locking makes no sense and is very harmful to pf as an activity when certain topics skew neg. for every link into tourism you read, +.5 speaks lol. i will never ever ever make any comments abt what you're wearing or how you speak. if a judge ever does, that's pretty fucked up. i don't care if u show up in designer clothes or sweats. i enjoyed debating in sweats, it's comfy. in outs, if i'm on a panel that's 2 other lays, u can tell me to judge it like a lay round and i will. (this means voting for the team that better establishes a narrative and is more convincing lol) Do crazy shit fr fr: g0 cRaaazeEEy!! tbh unpopular opinion but evidence is dumb, debate should be logical. obvi like use evidence if u want but warrants/analytics are perfecto. I genuinely think that debate would be better if it was just logical warranting, evidence is bad. (obviously evidence matters but: warrant + authors name vs. just warrant? meh p equal unless u give me good reasoning to prefer the evidence. unless the evidence is like a fact like ""x has increased y 200%"" is obviously better than a reason why x doesn't increase y) If at any point you believe that you have won the round with no way for the opponents to win, you can call a TKO, if you are correct it will be an auto W with 30s, but if you are incorrect it is a loss with 25s. Give a rebuttal in 2nd constructive (1st rebuttal will have to frontline if this happens) (if you read fast enough, you can still do case!) instant 30 if u do this cuz lol. Above all, just have fun! Debate can get stressful so just try to breathe, chill and relax in round. I WILL DISCLOSE AFTER EVERY ROUND NO EXCEPTIONS— HOLD ME TO THIS A haiku describing my judging philosophy: Weigh Warrants Logic Collapse Analysis Links WEIGH WEIGH COLLAPSE WEIGH plz remind me of how many speaks you should win based all the crazy stuff in here lol i'll forget what i put here "
"Please make your framework clear and, when necessary, address why your framework should prevail. When you clash with your opponents, I will judge your case based on how you weigh your arguments' significance relative to your opponents' arguments. Please do not spread. If you do, I may miss an argument or response. Do not be obnoxious with evidence transfer. Be efficient and do not eat up time unnecessarily rushing to find pieces of evidence. By the same token, only ask for those things that are crucially necessary to your responses. "
"I am a college student that competed in debate for six years from 7th - 12th grade. For debate I have no problem with speed, but please make sure I can understand points that are very important to your case. If is a key point, emphasize it and enunciate. I will only judge based off of what is said in the round. If you want me to know or do something you must tell me and make it painfully obvious to me what you want me to do. Please use supporting evidence in your arguments. If your argument doesn't have any supporting evidence or data, I will not take it as seriously as an argument with supporting evidence. "
"he / they My email for the chain is hbharper8@gmail.com but also feel free to reach out with questions about your round I am okay with anything you run as long as you are respectful Fun Facts: I do not like voting for disclosure theory nor topicality. On their own these arguments do not convince me, but I am open minded if you can make them really well No changing the structure of the round with theory I don't expect you to necessarily run a counterinterp against theory - I just want to see you engage with the argument You probably go for too much in summary In summary defense is sticky unless it was frontlined The second rebuttal should address the first rebuttal but I will accept responses in second sum as well, but no new turns No offensive off-case arguments in the second rebuttal Speaker points: Please do not call me sir. I appreciate funny taglines and puns when they are in good taste Yelling / being mean in cross will hurt your speaks "
"Prior substantial revisions: February 2022 - Minor LD paradigm changes January 2021 - PF revisions for Emory PGP: they/them Email chain: Yes, I do want to be on the email chain (saves time): learnthenouns[at]the-google-owned-one. No, I do not need you to flash me your evidence unless I ask (takes too long). Bio (not sure anyone reads these but whatever): I have competed in or coached almost everything and I am currently the head coach at Lincoln East. I’ve spent over half my life in this activity (14 years coaching, 7 years competing). My goal is to be the best judge possible for every debater. As such, please read my feedback as me being invested in your success. Also, if you have any questions at all I would rather you ask them than be confused, so using post-round questions as a chance to clarify your confusion is encouraged. Overview for all events -Debate is both educational and a game. I believe the education comes from it being an accepting and open community in which ideas engage with one another and students are empowered by finding their voice. The ""game"" element functions as an educational test of your effectiveness in presenting and defending your personal beliefs and advocacies. Thus, I consider myself a games player as it is a necessary component of the educational experience.-A major exception: I will not listen to arguments along the lines of “oppression doesn’t exist,” “genocide is good,” “society isn’t patriarchal,” ""anti-white racism is real"" etc. as these make for a hostile debate space and are also self-evidently false. These debates have (more or less) already been settled by society. I will never vote for them and will likely vote against you for running it even if your opponent doesn't make it an issue. [For more clarification on why I feel this way, please see the VBriefly article “Nobody Knows the Trouble I See"" by Jonathan Alston and Aaron Timmons. The article can be found here]. -I flow tags and warrants. I only flow author names if there’s nothing else to write down, so don't just rely on 'surname extensions' with zero warranting to get you through the round. I am more interested in the content of your arguments than the names of the person that you are citing. - On that note, while I want the speech doc, I will almost never flow from it. If I am using it, it will likely be for one of these reasons: (1.) If I need to read the speech doc as an accommodation for you. (2.) If there's a dispute over evidence or something like that which necessitates reading the doc. Otherwise, it's on you to make the argument clearly in the round. LD The most important specifics: - I consider myself a games player, so I primarily am looking to evaluate what 'wins out' in terms of argumentation in the debate. -I love creativity and being intellectually engaged, so I’m a good person to run your Kritik/project/performance/non-topical aff/art case in front of. Of course, I still need you to make it an argument if you want me to vote for you (singing a song isn't an auto-win, especially if you sing it poorly), but otherwise, fire away. - For your reference in terms of what I am most familiar with arguments wise, I coach a team that has typically run more critical lit (po-mo, anti-blackness, D&G, cap, fem, neolib, Butler etc) and often plays around with what some might call ""nontraditional strategies."" Though we often run more traditional philosophy (typically Levinas, Kant, util, or Rawls) and plan-text style cases as topics warrant. - Strike me if you have to use tricks or similar cheap strategies (i.e. blippy and arbitrary theory spikes/shells/tricks such as ""aff only gets 2 contentions"" or ""aff auto wins for talking"") to win rounds. They are not debating in any sense of the word, and I cannot think of any educational or competitive value that can be derived from promoting them. - I won't read the speech doc just because you can't be bothered to not slur your way through the constructive. - I generally feel that disclosure is good and spreading is fine (even an equalizer in some ways). However, there is a lot of debate to be had here (especially when topics like opacity and the surveillance of non-white debaters or ableism get raised), and I have voted for both sides of each issue multiple times. - Beyond that, I like just about every style of LD (again, other than tricks). I have greatly enjoyed judging everything from hyper-traditional to extremely fast and critical. I don't see any type as being inherently 'superior' to the others, so do what you do and I'll listen. How I vote: **Note: this is all assuming that no other debate happens to establish specific burdens or about the importance of any particular level of the debate. In other words, I am willing to rearrange the order I evaluate things in (assuming you actually win said argument ofc), so feel free to run your ""educators have an a priori obligation to endorse critical pedagogy"" argument or whatever.** -First, the role of the ballot, the role of the judge, and the burdens of each side are up for debate in front of me (and I actually enjoy hearing these debates). I believe LD is unique in that these roles are not always clearly prescribed or implied through the wording of the resolution and/or the rules. I tend to believe that these are a priori considerations (though that is up for debate as well) and thus are my first consideration when evaluating the round. - Next, I will resolve any procedurals (i.e. topicality, theory shells, etc) that have been raised. I will typically give greater weight to in-depth, comparative analysis and well-developed arguments rather than tagline extensions/shells. If you're going to run one of these, it needs to actually be an argument, not just a sentence or two thrown in at the end of your case (again, no ""tricks""). -Absent a ROTB/ROJ or procedural debate I look first to the value/crit/standard, so you should either A) clearly delineate a bright-line and reason to prefer your framework over your opponent's (not just the obnoxious 'mine comes first' debate please) or B) clearly show how your case/impacts/advocacy achieves your opponent's framework better (or both if you want to make me really happy….)-After framework (or in the absence of a clear way to evaluate the FW) I finally look to impacts. Clear impact analysis and weighing will always get preference over blippy extensions (you might be sensing a theme here).Other Specifics-Counter-plans: If an advocacy statement is not made in the AC or clearly agreed upon in c-x, and the neg runs a CP then I will allow the aff a little leeway to define their plan in the 1AR/CX. My threshold for CP's tends to vary somewhat by topic but is overall fairly high as they (sort of by definition) require a specific plan which is often not present in an aff LD case. Note: the recent choice by the NSDA to pick more policy-style topics has softened my stance significantly on the validity of the CP. I think that many of the recent topics borderline necessitate CPs in order to ensure the neg's access to a fair debate.-Speed: I'm cool with both speed as well as with speaking slowly and persuasively. You won't go too fast for me. The only caveat is that you need to be clear. If you are mumbling your way through cards to the point that I cannot understand you, I'll stop flowing/put my hand to my ear/shout 'clear.' Any arguments I miss due to your lack of clarity might as well not have happened. -For a more detailed breakdown of how I judge certain arguments, please see ""argument specifics"" in my policy paradigm. The only major differences are that I do think aff RVI's are semi-legit in LD because of time limits and I have a significantly higher threshold for CP's on a topic without clearly prescribed actors/actions. Policy In super-brief: - I am mostly down for whatever, but I prefer in-depth debate over blippy extensions. I am ultimately a games player though, so you do you. -If you plan to read a bunch of pre-written blocks that barely apply to your opponent's arguments then re-think your strat, please. I want teams to engage with each other's arguments (including T, framework, and case). The beauty of policy is that it allows for the in-depth, nuanced analysis that other events often lack. Sticking to a script rather than reacting to what's happening in the round ruins my favorite part of this event.-I flow internal warrants and tags more often than author names so don’t rely on me knowing what “extend Smith #3 in 2k12” means in the grand scheme of the debate and, similarly, don’t power tag or plan to mumble your way through cards because I’m listening and will call you on it.-Unless explicitly framed otherwise, I usually default to believing that real-world impacts are of more importance than imaginary impacts. Debate shapes our perceptions and our discourse often spills over, so responsibility for this is important. This applies to policymakers as much as K debaters so keep this in mind as you debate framing and solvency. However, this is not set in stone. If you frame it otherwise and win that framing then I will evaluate the round accordingly.-Weighing your impacts and warranting your solvency throughout the whole round (not just the rebuttals) is a quick way to win my ballot. Otherwise, I vote off the flow/what I’m told to vote for.Argument specifics:-Speed and delivery: In the hundreds (or maybe thousands?) of rounds that I have been in, watched, and judged I have only seen one or two people that even approach being too fast (both were in college), you just must be exceptionally clear and articulate on the tags, warrants, and analytics if you are planning on topping 400wpm (might even be worth it to knock the speed down a notch on these things). I also expect a very well-organized flow once you start to approach top speeds (outline style numbering/lettering can help a bunch....). Pet peeve: speed=/=clear. ""Speed"" is for how fast you are going. ""Clear"" is for mumbling. I can handle pretty fast speeds, I can't handle a lack of clarity. I will usually give you one warning, two if I am feeling generous (or if you request it) and then will start docking speaks. I am also good with you going slow. Though since I can handle very fast speeds, I would suggest you give some impacted out reasons for going slow so as to avoid being spread out of the round. -Kritiks/K Affs/performance/ID tix/whatever: I’m a good person to run your critical case in front of. I love K’s/critical/performance/id tix/new debate/most things nontraditional, I'm familiar with a lot of the lit and ran a lot of these arguments myself. I do not believe that the aff needs to act through the USFG to be topical and, in fact, engaging with the res in other ways (personal advocacy, genealogy, micropolitics, deconstruction etc) can be reasonably topical and often can provide better education and personal empowerment. For clarity, as long as you are engaging with a general premise or an interpretation of the resolution then I believe the aff can claim reasonable topicality. That being said, to be an effective advocate for these things in the real world, you have to be able to justify your method and forum, so the same is true in debate. Two implications for this: 1. Neg has every right to, and often should, still test them with T/framework, see below for more details on that. 2. I am increasingly persuaded by the argument that if you are going to be expressly nontopical on the aff (as in advocating for something with no relation to the topic and zero attempts to engage the resolution), then you need to be prepared with a reason for not discussing the res. -Trad/policy-maker/stock issues debate: most of the circuits I debated in have leaned much more traditional so I am extremely familiar with both how to win with and how to beat a topical aff strat. My top varsity team this year tends to run trad as much as critical. That said, if you've ever debated against me or one of my students (or looked at their wikis) in years past, you know that that's not the game we usually play. So basically, I'm totally down to judge a topical debate but you shouldn't assume that I already know the nuances of how a specific DA or CP works without a little explanation.-Framework and theory: I love: debate about the forum, method, role of the judge/ballot, and impact calc. Making the other team justify their method is almost always a good thing. I strongly dislike (and subsequently have a high threshold for): generic USFG/policy-making good fw, spec shells, K's are cheating args and most debate theory arguments that ask me to outright dismiss your opponent for some silly reason. Real talk, almost none of us are going to be future policymakers (meaning alternative ways of engaging the topic are valuable) and wiki disclosure/pre-round prep checks most abuse, so these arguments are largely bunk. I want you to engage with your opponent's case, not be lazy by reading a shell that hasn't been updated since 2010. As with most things though, I will vote for it if you justify it and win the flow (you might be sensing a theme here....).-Topicality: I L-O-V-E a good T debate. Here are a few specifics to keep in mind: -Counterplans: I like the idea of the CP debate but I'm honestly not well versed in it (I probably closed on a CP twice in 7 years of debate). Basically, I understand the fundamentals quite well but will admit to lacking some knowledge of the deeper theoretical and 'techy' aspects of the CP. So feel free to run them but if you are going to get into super tech-heavy CP debate then be warned that you will need to explain things well or risk losing me. PF Theory (since this will probably impact your strikes the most, I will start here) In short, I think theory has an important role to play in PF as we develop more clearcut, nationwide norms for the event. When it's necessary and/or run well, I did it. I have sat through enough painful evidence exchanges and caught enough team misrepresenting their evidence that I would prefer teams to have ""cut cards"" cases and exchange them at the start of their speech. If one side elects not to do this, I am willing to vote on theory regarding evidence ethics (assuming it's argued and extended properly). Questions about this? Email me in advance (my email is up top). To clarify/elaborate on the above: I am very much down for disclosure theory and paraphrasing theory in PF. Irl I think both are true and good arguments. If you don't want to disclose or you refuse to run cut card cases rather than paraphrased cases, you should strike me. I am not quite as keen on other types of theory in PF, but given how quickly my attitude was changed on paraphrasing, I am very much open to having my mind changed. Overview for PF Generally speaking, I see PF as a more topic-centric policy round where the resolution acts as the plan text. This, of course, depends on the topic, but this view seems to generally provide for a consistent and fair means to evaluate the round. Truth vs tech While my default in other events is tech over truth, I find that PF tends to lend itself to a balance of tech and truth due to the fact that teams are rarely able to respond to every argument on the flow. ""Truth"" to me is determined by warranting and explanation (so still tied to an extent to tech). As such, better-warranted arguments will get more weight over blippy or poorly explained arguments. Speed I can handle pretty much any speed since policy is my main event. However, if you're going fast, your analysis better be more in-depth (and NOT more blippy) as a result. A final word of caution on speed is that PFers often suck at proper speed reading. There's a reason that good policy debaters vary pitch, cadence, volume, and speed throughout their speech. Other PF specifics: I tend to prefer the final focus to be less focused on line-by-line and more focused on framing, impact weighing, and round story. Though again, given my experience in LD and Policy, I can definitely handle line-by-line, just don't forget to warrant things out. All evidence used in the round should be accessible for both sides. Failure to provide evidence in a timely manner when requested will result in either reduced speaker points or an auto loss (depending on the severity of the offense). I also reserve the right to start a team's prep time up if they are taking an excessively long time to share their stuff. On that note, I will call for evidence and I appreciate it when teams help me know what to call for. I know that paraphrasing is the norm at this point but I do not love it as it leads to a lot of teams that excessively spin or outright lie about evidence. Tell me to call for it if it's junk evidence and I'll do so. I will apply the NSDA guidelines regarding paraphrasing when it is justified, so make sure you are familiar with those rules so that you can avoid doing it and know to call your opponents out when they slip up. I hate bullying in crossfire. I dock speaker points for people that act like jerks. (not sure this is still a thing anywhere but just in case....) The team that speaks first does not need to extend their own case in their first rebuttal since nothing has been said against it yet. In fact, I prefer they don't as it decreases clash and takes the only advantage they have from speaking first. Congress Background: I am the head debate coach at Lincoln East. While I only competed locally when I was in high school, I have spent the last few years coaching a more circuit-oriented team. In the last 3 years, I have had 4 TOC qualifiers, 8 national qualifiers, a state champion, and an NSDA Senate finalist. This is also the event that I tend to be most hands-on in terms of helping with prep (I usually research at least 2-3 bills for each circuit tournament that we attend), so there's a reasonable chance that I've researched at least some of the docket if you have me as a judge. Generally speaking, I see Congress as being best judged on 3 factors: the strength of argumentation, speaking abilities, and round presence. I will briefly outline my expectations for each below. Feel free to ask if anything doesn't make sense. Also, for Nebraska debaters reading this before quals, please do not treat this like other debate events. If you speed read your speech, try to do 'line-by-line,' run a kritik, or anything else that is clearly not intended for Congress you can expect that you will not be ranked and your speech scores will be exceptionally low. Argumentation: A good portion of this comes from the logic and evidence presented in your speech. Things I consider include factual accuracy, logical consistency, recency of evidence, and internal warranting. I also will listen to questioning to assess how well you are able to defend your arguments, so please take questioning seriously! Speaking abilities: While I mostly did LD and Congress in high school, I dabbled in speech and I now teach communication studies. I feel that Congress is unique among debate events in that the structure is such that it allows students to utilize more persuasive elements during their speeches. Thus, you should not operate under the assumption that I'm going to treat this like a Policy or LD round. I will factor the quality of the speaker into my assessment. I look for things like body language/gestures, paralinguistic elements of vocal delivery (ie tone, pace, volume, emphasis, etc), speech structure (including your intro/preview, and internal argument structure) and word choice/diction. This also includes during questioning. Round presence: By this, I mean your role in advancing the debate, questioning speakers, and ensuring the chamber is efficient. I will be looking for refutation and extension of prior arguments that help keep the debate. On this note, I hate rehash as it either indicates a lack of awareness of what prior speakers have said, or an inability to adapt your speeches on the fly. I also am looking at how your questions contribute to the debate as well as how they demonstrate an understanding of the round and topic. Finally, I am expecting that you help ensure the chamber is efficient by recognizing when motions are necessary and appropriate. For example, if the debate has clearly reached its endpoint on a bill, I really appreciate a representative that will move the previous question so that we aren't beating a dead horse. A note for POs: I will rank POs. My team has had several students who made a habit of winning tournaments as POs, so I very much respect the skill of a good PO. However, it is not automatic. Typically, for a PO to get ranked, they should run an efficient house. A great PO is notable not because they are constantly inserting themselves, but rather because they have such clear and effective procedures in place that I barely have to think about them until they are needed. That said, I do think that if the house is 'out of order' (ie they are doing things like going over time, not following procedures or, god forbid, being offensive) a good PO will step in to remind the house of the rules and decorum that are expected of them. Important for in-person tournaments: I would ask that students wear at all times masks while debating. This is a matter of accessibility and respect for those with compromised immune systems. As a cancer survivor, this is something I am pretty serious about. If one side elects not to, I would be open to/like to hear a theory argument about it from the masked debater(s). "
"(4 years of PF) UVA '24 Winning my ballot starts with weighing, in fact, weighing is so important I'd prefer if you did it at the begiNning of every speech after first rebuttal. Be cOmparative, I need a reason why I should look to your arguments firsT. Please collapse, don't go for more than one case arg in the second half, its unnecessaRy. I'm a lazy judge the easIest plaCe to vote is where I'll sign my ballot. I'm not going to do more worK than I need to. I will not vote off of one sentence offense, everything needS to be explained clearly, warranted, and weighed for me to evaluate it(turns especially). I try not to presume but if I do, I will presume whoever lost the coin flip. I will evaluate progressive arguments. If you are going to give a content warning please do it correctly - this means anonymized content warnings with ample time to respond. I'm very generous with speaks, speaking style doesn't affect how I evaluate the round and I don't think I'm in a place to objectively evaluate the way you speak. With that being said I will not tolerate rudeness or ANY bm in round. I can handle a decent amount of speed but do not let speed trade off with quality. Online debate I will be muted the entire round just assume I'm ready before every speech and time yourselves and your own prep. I will disclose if the tournament allows.

"Since I judge a lot more Public Forum now than the other events, my paradigm now reflects more about that activity than the others. I've left some of the LD/Policy stuff in here because I end up judging that at some big tournaments for a round or two. If you have questions, please ask. NONTRADITIONAL ARGUMENTS: These arguments are less prevalent in PF than they are in other forms. The comments made here still hold true to that philosophy. I'll get into kritiks below because I have some pretty strong feelings about those in both LD and PF. It's probably dealt with below, but you need to demonstrate why your project, poem, rap, music, etc. links to and is relevant to the topic. Theory for theory's sake is not appealing to me. In short, the resolution is there for a reason. Use it. It's better for education, you learn more, and finding relevancy for your particular project within a resolutional framework is a good thing.THEORY: When one defines theory, it must be put into a context. The comments below are dated and speak more to the use of counterplans. If you are in LD, read this because I do think the way that counterplans are used in LD is not ""correct."" In PF, most of the topics are such that there are comparisons to be made. Policies should be discussed in general terms and not get into specifics that would require a counterplan. For LD/Policy Counterplan concepts: I consider myself to be a policy maker. The affirmative is making a proposal for change; the negative must demonstrate why the outcome of that adoption may be detrimental or disadvantageous. Counterplans are best when nontopical and competitive. Nontopical means that they are outside of the realm of the affirmative’s interpretation of the resolution (i.e. courts counterplans in response to congressional action are legitimate interpretations of n/t action). Competitive means there must be a net-benefit to the counterplan. Merely avoiding a disadvantage that the affirmative “gets” could be enough but that assumes of course that you also win the disadvantage. I’m not hip deep sometimes in the theory debate and get frustrated when teams choose to get bogged down in that quagmire. If you’re going to run the counterplan conditionally, then defend why it’s OK with some substance. If the affirmative wishes to claim abuse, prove it. What stopped you from adequately defending the case because the counterplan was “kicked” in the block or the 2NR? Don’t whine; defend the position. That being said, I'm not tied to the policy making framework. As you will see below, I will consider most arguments. Not a real big fan of performance, but if you think it's your best strategy, go for it.TOPIC SPECIFIC ARGUMENTS: I’m not a big “T” hack. Part of the reason for that is that persons sometimes get hung up on the line by line of the argument rather than keeping the “big picture” in mind. Ripping through a violation in 15 seconds with “T is voting issue” tacked on at the bottom doesn’t seem to have much appeal from the beginning. I’m somewhat persuaded by not only what the plan text says but what the plan actually does. Plan text may be topical but if your evidence indicates harm area, solvency, etc. outside of the realm of the topic, I am sympathetic that the practice may be abusive to the negative.KRITIKS/CRITIQUES: The comments about kritiks below are linked more to policy debate than LD or PF. However, at the risk of being ostracized by many, here is my take on kritiks in PF and maybe LD. They don't belong. Now, before you start making disparaging remarks about age, and I just don't get it, and other less than complimentary things, consider this. Most kritiks are based on some very complex and abstract concepts that require a great deal of explanation. The longest speech in PF is four minutes long. If you can explain such complex concepts in that time frame at a comprehensible speaking rate, then I do admire you. However, the vast majority of debaters don't even come close to accomplishing that task. There are ways you can do that, but look at the section on evidence below. In short, no objection to kritiks; just not in PF. LD comes pretty close to that as well. Hint: You want to argue this stuff, read and quote the actual author. Don't rely on some debate block file that has been handed down through several generations of debaters and the only way you know what the argument says is what someone has told you. Here's the original of what was written: True confession time here—I was out of the activity when these arguments first came into vogue. I have, however, coached a number of teams who have run kritiks. I’d like to think that advocating a position actually means something. If the manner in which that position is presented is offensive for some reason, or has some implication that some of us aren’t grasping, then we have to examine the implications of that action. With that in mind, as I examine the kritik, I will most likely do so within the framework of the paradigm mentioned above. As a policymaker, I weigh the implications in and outside of the round, just like other arguments. If I accept the world of the kritik, what then? What happens to the affirmative harm and solvency areas? Why can’t I just “rethink” and still adopt the affirmative? Explain the kritik as well. Again, extending line by line responses does little for me unless you impact and weigh against other argumentation in the round. Why must I reject affirmative rhetoric, thoughts, actions, etc.? What is it going to do for me if I do so? If you are arguing framework, how does adopting the particular paradigm, mindset, value system, etc. affect the actions that we are going to choose to take? Yes, the kritik will have an impact on that and I think the team advocating it ought to be held accountable for those particular actions.EVIDENCE: I like evidence. I hate paraphrasing. Paraphrasing has now become a way for debaters to put a bunch of barely explained arguments on the flow that then get blown up into voting issues later on. If you paraphrase something, you better have the evidence to back it up. I'm not talking about a huge PDF that the other team needs to search to find what you are quoting. The NSDA evidence rule says specifically that you need to provide the specific place in the source you are quoting for the paraphrasing you have used. Check the rule; that's what I and another board member wrote when we proposed that addition to the evidence rule. If you like to paraphrase and then take fifteen minutes to find the actual evidence, you don't want me in the back of the room. I will give you a reasonable amount of time and if you don't produce it, I'll give you a choice. Drop the evidence or use your prep time to find it. If your time expires, and you still haven't found it, take your choice as to which evidence rule you have violated. In short, if you paraphrase, you better have the evidence to back it up. Original text: I like to understand evidence the first time that it is read. Reading evidence in a blinding montone blur will most likely get me to yell “clear” at you. Reading evidence after the round is a check for me. I have found in the latter stages of my career that I am a visual learner and need to see the words on the page as well as hear them. It helps for me to digest what was said. Of course, if I couldn’t understand the evidence to begin with, it’s fairly disappointing for me. I may not ask for it if that is the case. I also like teams that do evidence comparisons. What does your evidence take into account that the other teams evidence does not? Weigh and make that claim and I will read the evidence to see if you indeed have made a good point. SPEECH DOCUMENTS: Given how those documents are currently being used, I will most likely want to be a part of any email exchange. However, I may not look at those electronic documents until the end of the debate to check my flow against what you claim has been read in the round. Debate is an oral activity; let's get back to that.STYLE: As stated above, if you are not clear, I will tell you so. If I have to tell you more than once, I will give much less weight to the argument than you wish me to do so. I have also found in recent years that I don't hear nearly as well as in the past. You may still go fast, but crank it down just a little bit so that this grumpy old man can still understand the argument. Tag-team CX is okay as long as one partner does not dominate the discussion. I will let you know when that becomes the case. Profanity and rude behavior will not be tolerated. If you wish me to disclose and discuss the argument, you may challenge respectfully and politely. Attempts at making me look ridiculous (which at times is not difficult) to demonstrate your superior intelligence does little to persuade me that I was wrong. My response may very well be “If I’m so stupid, why did you choose to argue things this way?” I do enjoy humor and will laugh at appropriate attempts at it. If you have any other questions, please feel free to ask. Make them specific. Just a question which starts with ""Do you have a paradigm?"" will most likely be answered with a ""yes"" with little or no explanation beyond that. You should get the picture from that. "
"Email chain/ questions: char.char.jackson21@gmail.com  they/them As a topshelf thing, I will probably vote for arguments I don't understand LD Paradigm:  arguments in order that i am comfy with them are theory>larp>K's>tricks> phil i can flow p much any spreading as long as its clear if i have a problem i will say something I will vote on any argument as long as its not problematic, only if you sufficiently extend warrant, and implicate said argument. PF Paradigm:  If you want the easy path to my ballot; weigh, implicate your defense/turns, tell me why you should win.  Debate is a game, as such I will normally be a tech>truth judge except in circumstances where I deem an argument to be offensive/inappropriate for the debate space. Rebuttal:I prefer a line by line. Second rebuttal should respond to turns/disads. I allow the first speaking team to extend defense from first rebuttal to first final focus. If you’re gonna read a super long overview or have a weird speech order please let me know before you start talking. Extensions:  I wont do ghost extensions for you even if the argument is conceded, extend your arguments. Arguments that I am comfortable with: Theory, T, Plans, Counter Plans, Disads, Kritiks, most framework args that PFers can come up with. Presumption  I presume too much, tell me why I should presume for you if you think you aren't going to win your case, if you don't make any arguments as to why I should presume I will presume based on a coin flip, aff will be heads and neg will be tails. I also think I will be starting to vote more on risk of offense, in this scenario. debate is problematic in many ways. if there is anything I can do to make the round more accessible, please let me know beforehand "
"Hello! I am a parent judge (lay). This is my 3rd year judging PF so I know the structure of a PF round well.  A couple of key things Don’t spread. If you speak too fast, I won’t understand anything you say and you’ll likely lose the round. It will also affect your speaker points. Don’t run theory, K’s, or progressive arguments. I don't know what those are (my son wrote this part) and I don’t know how to evaluate them and it just leads to a confusing round. You’ll also likely lose the round if you do :) It’s okay to paraphrase evidence, but misconstruing it is unethical and not allowed. Don’t run anything racist, homophobic, discriminatory, etc. This is a clear violation of PF rules and will lead to you losing the round and <25 speaker points. Additional consequences may follow. Please time yourself for each speech. Please be honest with your prep time and be responsible for keeping your opponent’s prep time as well. I will be listening in CX but if something important happens in CX, make sure to bring it up in later speeches. In terms of the argument, make sure to walk me down through the entire argument and explain it in enough depth. I want well-warranted links and evidence. Don’t just say “X causes Y”, tell me why. If your argument doesn't make sense to me, it will be really hard for you to win.  In summary, collapse. Don’t go for everything. You’re better off explaining the 1 winning contention than explaining every single thing that happened in the round. Make sure to defend your case well. In FF, you should be writing the ballot for me. Everything you said in Summary should be in FF. Tell me your voter points. Don’t bring up new arguments here and abuse 2nd FF. It’s not fair. At the end of the day, debate should be a fun activity and debaters should enjoy it. I love clashes in the round but don’t be rude to your opponents. Be respectful in rounds to both your partner and your opponents. Enjoy! "
"Hi I'm Ellie and I'm a student at Cornell University, and I'm the older sister of a debater. I'm a lay judge so: 1) Speak slowly 2) Send a speech doc/put me on the email chain ellieyji@gmail.com 3) No debate jargon please 4) Implicate and warrant basically everything 5) No K's, theory, trix, etc. 6) Signpost, roadmap, and let me know which speech you're about to start 7) Time your own speeches and prep. I evaluate based off of persuasive speaking and the quality of arguments on the flow. I will not evaluate new responses in back half. I cannot guarantee a hack for conceded arguments if they are presented poorly. L20 if you speak at a rate which I can't understand. Weigh and provide empirical evidence. Please do not paraphrase, I prefer evidence to back your arguments. I will probably down you if you paraphrase. Shoutout to A&M Consolidated DS, LW, and LJ :) "
"I have been coaching and judging debate rounds since 1987.   I expect each kind of debate to resemble its intended design.   I will flow the debate.  I will stop flowing the debate when time is up.  I will not listen to anything once the time has elapsed.   I do not want to read all of your evidence at the end of the round; I want to be able to hear it the first time you articulate it clearly.   You should tell me “where I am voting.” You should tell me “how I can vote for you there.” You should tell me “why I am voting there and not somewhere else.” This means I am not doing this for you; you weigh the round for me.  I want to hear a clear narrative that has some resemblance of a clear framework, which deals with terms and concepts fairly. In the absence of weighing, I tend to look for clear offense rather than doing weighing for you. (this means things that were dropped and clearly extended) "
"Email- JKaminskii34@gmail.com My debate experience: Current assistant coach at Trinity Prep 3 Years of NFA-LD Debate (Current debater at Illinois State University) 4 Years of Public Forum debate 4 Years of Congressional debate Paradigm- It should be pretty easy to win my ballot. In my opinion, debate is a game, and you should play to win. Here are the specific things most debaters would want to know. PF - I am cool with speed, so long as you don't use it to push your opponents out of a round. I will call clear if you become hard to understand, so keep that in mind. - I will evaluate all types of arguments equally unless told otherwise. - I am willing to listen to things like K's and theory arguments, so long as they are impacted out in the round. - I really enjoy framework debates as well. I think these can be particularly beneficial for limiting the ground your opponents have in the round. - I am tech over truth, which means so long as it is on my flow, I will evaluate the argument regardless of my own feelings on it. I will also not flow arguments through ink on the flow, so be sure to engage with your opponents answers in order to win the link level of your argument. - Summary and FF should be somewhat consistent in terms of the direction they are going. Inconsistencies between these speeches will be harmful, especially when it comes to evaluating the strengths of your links and impacts - On that same note, I want to see some sort of collapse in the second half of the debate- going for everything is typically a bad strategy, and I want to reward smart strategic choices that you make. - I default to a net benefits impact calc, unless given a competing way to view the round. I am cool viewing the round through any lens that you give me, so long as you explain why its the best way for me to evaluate the round. If absent, I have to intervene with my own, which is something I hate to do. - If you want me to call for cards, you need to ask me to do so. In that same regard, I wont intervene unless you leave me no other option. - I dont flow CX, so if you want me to hold something that was said as binding, you need to bring it up in all of the subsequent speeches. -Speaker points, in my opinion, are less about your speaking performance and more about your ability to present and explain compelling arguments, interact with the opposition, and provide meaningful analysis as to why you are necessarily more important. Content above style -On a more personal note, I want the rounds that I judge to be educational and allow debaters to articulate arguments about real world issues, all of which deserve respect regardless of your own personal opinions. I have seen my partners and teammates experience sexism, racism, and other types of discrimination, and I have absolutely zero tolerance for it when I am judging. - If you have any other questions about my paradigm, please feel free to ask me. I also will give feedback after rounds, you just have to find me and ask. "
"chazkinz [at] gmail [dot] com he/him/his 350+ VLD rounds since 2018 I study IR and English at the University of Florida. Conflicts: Durham AA and BT, Charlotte Latin EL and AP, Valley. Currently with Lake Highland. This is a consolidated paradigm updated in April 2021. ----------- A note on theory in PF: I do not like theory in PF. However, I feel uncomfortable not evaluating arguments because I do believe that debaters should not be ignored in what they say and how they want to debate. Most times when I vote on theory (either the interp or, most often, the RVI) it is because the other team does not understand the technicalities of theory debate even though they may have initially started the theory flow. Don't read theory against teams that obviously don't know what it is. Don't read theory if there is a chance your opponents will out-do you on the theory flow. I am a fan of the RVI, especially in PF. ----------- Updates: a] Speaks are capped at 27 if you include something in the doc that you assume will be inputted into the round without you reading it. You cannot ""insert"" something into the debate scot free. Examples include charts, spec details, and solvency details. This is a terrible norm and you are literally asking me to evaluate a card/analytics that you didn't read. If you think ""it only matters if they ask in CX,"" then why did you include it in the doc?b] I strongly encourage you to record local copies of your speeches, but this is not something that I can expect/mandate out of all debaters. c] Online debate is alienating. I am now more than ever impressed by high school debaters that continue to engage in this rigorous activity as we live through a mass death event. Take care of yourself and let me know if there is something I can do to better accommodate you in this virtual terrain. d] Slam dunk 2NRs (esp on the K) are easily my favorite part of LD. e] I'm now in the world of PF...so yeah. A few notes on this: 1] ""Fast"" PF is actually harder to flow than LD/Policy because of all the cards that PF cases throw at me 2] being able to analyze factual information and draw conclusions is one of the most valuable aspects of debate. ""dO yOu hAvE a cArD fOr tHAt"" as a response to an argument that scares you makes you lose a lot of credibility to me. 3] Disclosure is probably a good norm in PF, but I don't want to hear disclosure theory in PF rounds. I don't want to hear theory in PF rounds. ----------- Debate is what you make it, whether that is a game or an educational activity. Ultimately, it is a space for students to grow intellectually and politically. It is a very important form of education. K debate: I love it. I’m familiar with most authors, but assume that I know nothing. I want to hear about the alt. My academic focus in school is Frankfurt School critical theory and some Lacan. In debate, I have prepped and coached pretty much the full spectrum of K debate authors/literature bases. Policy debate: Love it. I like good analytics more than cards, especially when those cards are from authors that are clearly personally/institutionally biased. Inserted graphs/charts need to explained and should not be arguments in and of themselves. Taglines should be descriptive of the warrants in the card. 2 or 3 condo is acceptable. I am not thrilled with the idea of judge kicking. T Debate: I’ve heard too much of it. If there is a topic-specific interp that you’re a fan of and execute well, go for it. I am so tired of judging Nebel T debates that come down to PICs every other round. For framework, I think that out of round impacts (advocacy skills, movement building) are more convincing than in round impacts (procedural fairness, etc.), especially when answering micropolitical affs. Theory Debate: Increasingly okay with it. Disclosure is good but frivolous disclosure theory is annoying. If you find yourself debating with me as the judge on a panel with a parent/lay/traditional judge (or judges), please just engage in a traditional round and don't try to get my tech ballot. It is incredibly rude to disregard a parent's ballot and spread in front of them if they are apprehensive about it. ----------- Random things: "
"Seven lakes High School '21 | University of Texas at Dallas '24 contact: pkasibhatla4@gmail.com Debate experience: I mainly participated in PF debate throughout high school at both local and national tournaments PF: - I am a standard flow judge who evaluates tech over truth. - Okay with any arguments along as they are not offensive, racist, homophobic, etc. - I am fine with speed as long as everyone in the round can clearly hear the arguments. I do not like spreading. - Evidence: Paraphrasing is fine as long as you don't blatantly misconstrued the evidence. When providing paraphrased evidence please give the specific line that you reference. Evidence ethics are important, call your opponents out for any misconstrued evidence, false claims or any lies. - Speaker points: Speaker points are awarded based on strategy and obviously how well you speak. As mentioned above, I will dock both speaker points and drop you if you have bad evidence ethics. Moreover, i'll give bonus speaker points if the round is entertaining and respectful. Being rude and loud will only decrease your speaker points so don't do that - Give a roadmap of the speech beforehand and signpost throughout the speech. - To extend an argument you must extend the contention name, the name of the cards and more importantly what the card says. You can't just tell me to extend 'x card' without telling me why the card is important to both your argument and the round. Speaking of extensions, the round should flow from your constructive to the final focus. The second rebuttal should respond to all offensive arguments or I consider them as drops. First summary must extend arguments and defense if it's responded to in second rebuttal. I will more than likely be voting on both the cleanest argument. - Weighing is great, the more you weigh throughout the round the easier it is for me to vote. Please start weighing during rebuttals. New weighing after second summary is too late and I will not evaluate that. - Any arguments or concessions during Cross must be brought up in speeches. - If you read a framework, read warrants. The Framework debate must include weighing. - Final focus should have the same arguments as summary Email me if you have any questions! "
"Hello, I am a parent judge. Please speak slow enough that the average person can hear clearly. If I don't understand something I will not flow. Couple of things: - I like off time roadmaps. - I don't vote on crossfire. - Please frontline/defend your case. Speaker Points: Confident and clear speaking will get you a higher score. Clear enunciation. Use tones. Do not speak monotonously. When you are saying something important, make it clear that it is important, whether through your words, your voice, or both. "

"I did 3 years of public forum at Poly Prep (2015-2018) and I'm a senior at uchicago. Email chain: sophialam@polyprep.org - here's how i make my decision: i look at who wins the weighing/framework. I evaluate that argument. If you win the weighing/framework and the offense with a terminalized impact, you'll probably win. If no one weighs then I'm gonna go with scope or the argument with the least ink. - I don't like frivolous theory. If you read it you better go for it. Ks are cool, but I reserve the right to intervene if I feel like you're running it in a problematic/game-y way. - I like warrants. If they provide a warrant and your only response is ""they don't have evidence for this"" but it logically makes sense, I'm likely to give them some ground. I prefer your counter warrant/ev as a response rather than just their lack of supporting evidence. - speed is fine as long as you aren't speaking unclearly. - First summary doesn't have to extend defense from rebuttal unless second rebuttal frontlines. Turns/Offense you want me to vote on need to be in both summary and final focus. - I don't flow crossfire. If it's important, say it in a speech - I don't time, if your opponents are telling me time is up I'll stop flowing but give them at least 5 seconds. Don't hold up your timer .5 seconds after the speech time is over - i default neg if there's no offense "
"Hello! I am a lay judge. While I don't have any debate experience, I am not a stranger to debate. I have been in legal practice for over 20 years and currently a patent examiner. I am familiar with looking at ideas, reviewing and examining evidences, and considering arguments before drawing conclusions. Please add me yanlilylan@gmail.com to the email chain. Please include at least the cases and call the email chain like ""TOC Round 1 - Team AB vs. Team CD"". I will increase your speaker points if you do an email chain with your cards prior to your speech. As a judge, I prefer for the debaters to warrant out all their arguments, do not make an assertion and not give the reasoning. Make sure to weigh, if you don't I might make a decision you aren't happy about. You can run anything, so long as you are clear, weigh it, and tell me why it’s the best way to adjudicate the round. I prefer evidence over just logical reasoning but logic is a very good tool to supplement evidence or for other responses. Please make sure you signpost. In terms of speed, talk normal speed. I only flow what I can understand. If I can't grasp the arguments due to speed, it is your loss. At the end of the day, debate should be fun and debaters should enjoy the activity. Heated arguments are expected, but rudeness is not good. "

You still have to weigh and have a ballot story. - Theory - proceed with caution; I have a high threshold, and gut-check a lot - Spikes that try to become 2N or 2A extensions for triggering the ballot is a poor strategy in front of me - I don't care where you sit, or if you sit or stand; I do care that you are respectful to me and your opponent. - If you cannot explain it in a 45 minute round, how am I supposed to understand it enough to vote on it. - My tolerance for just reading prep in a round that you didn't write, and you don't know how it works is really low. I get cranky easily and if it isn't shown with my ballot, it will be shown with my speaker points. OTHER THINGS - I'll give comments after every round, and if the tournament allows it, I'll disclose the decision. I don't disclose points. - My expectation is that you keep your items out prior to the critique, and you take notes. Debaters who pack up, and refuse to use critiques as a learning experience of something they can grow from risk their speaker points. I'm happy to change points after a round based on a students willingness to listen, or unwillingness to take constructive feedback. "
Present your case to me as if I am an average citizen attending a city council meeting. 
"Hi, I did Public Forum debate for four years at Lake Mary Prep in Orlando, Florida. Some things I like: Warrants and lines of logic over evidence that is unwarranted Weighing, the earlier the better Front-lining in Second Rebuttal. You don't have to do this but I think it is a good idea Narratives Collapsing ***** 3 min summary does not mean go for more, just COLLAPSE BETTER ***** My coach always used to say ""50% fewer arguments and 100% more analysis"" Some things I don't like: Miscut Evidence. I am fine with paraphrasing but please make sure its an accurate representation of the evidence (I reserve the right to drop you if it is seriously misrepresented) Blippy Arguments that are not weighed, warranted, or implicated Spreading Theory / Ks unless there is a serious issue or abuse in the topic or the round. I am also really bad at understanding these, so you should probably strike me if this is your thing. Any bigoted argument I will immediately drop you no questions asked. To Summarize, In the poetic words of Ozan Ergrunor: weigh i begged you but you didn’t and you lost "
"Director of Policy Debate @ Stanford University; Director of Debate @ Edgemont Jr./Sr. High School (High School Constraints - Edgemont) (College Constraints - Stanford, Harvard, Kentucky and a crew of exceptionally talented college debaters I've had the pleasure to coach) 2020-2021 Update: Christmas Edition Misunderstanding Tech over Truth: Those three words hurt my soul because they've become to only symbolize that a dropped argument is a true argument in most circles; however, it should symbolize that well-done technical debate overcomes the truthful nature of any argument. I want to see you technically execute an argument you've spent time learning and understanding and I'm willing to listen to any argument that shows me this was done. This is significantly different from ""I will listen to anything."" Research->Knowledge->Execution: That's the order! I love when students do a lot of column A to make column C easy. Clarity Trumps: Speed is irrelevant to me. I've been doing debate for a quarter-century and I've judged people at various speeds. The most important part of the debate is clearly communicating ideas to an audience. I speak very fast, so I realize it's inevitable; however, if you're not understood then nothing you do matters. Remember, what you think you said is not always what the other person hears you say. Policy Debate: What happened to strategies? The trend is to read 3-4 counterplans in the 1nc, rather than debating the case. Fewer off-case positions, with more time invested in debating the case, is usually a more successful strategy to create pressure on 2a's helping you win more ballots. 2020-2021 PF Update: December 21, 2020 I want to see the best version of you debating! As you can tell my opinions on PF have changed dramatically in the past six seasons; however, I still enjoy judging debates when you're trying your best!! Theory: I'm totally uninterested in PF theory. It's underdeveloped, not well explained, and has no foundational basis in the activity. Evidence: If the tournament doesn't adhere to a specific set of evidence rules, I will default to NSDA evidence rules. Paraphrasing is allowed unless otherwise prohibited, but must follow the rules. I will no longer ask for cases or cards before the debate. I do expect that if a piece of evidence or a card doc is requested that it can be produced in a timely manner. To expedite this process, I will allow the other team to prep during the transfer time for a card doc to be sent to the other team unless it's specifically prohibited by the tournament. Wiki: I don't look at it. My personal preference is that teams would disclose if the other team asks but I am not policing these conversations. I personally believe that understanding the arguments you are debating (if they've been read before) produces better debate; however, am uninterested in listening to a debate about disclosure being good or bad unless something unethical was done during the disclosure process. 2017-2018 PF TOC Update: April 23rd, 2018 As you can see I used to have a very strong leaning towards how evidence needs to be presented during a debate. I've backtracked pretty substantially on this point. Therefore, I won't ask for your case ahead of time. However, I do still prefer evidence that is directly quoted and cited according to the rules of the tournament we are at. I do not like paraphrasing and will only accept paraphrasing as a logical argument to be made in the round and will not credit you for reading a qualified author. I know a lot about debate, arguments, and the topics you are debating. I have an extremely competitive set of students that are constantly talking about the topic, I tutor students around the world in PF, and I generally like to be educated on the things that students will debate in front of me. Beyond what I've said above, I'll give you an additional piece of advice: If you would strike Stefan Bauschard or Amisha Mehta then you'd probably want to strike me. I tend to fall somewhere in between where they are at in their philosophies. Last but not least, I don't intend to steal your cards...we have more than we can use...however if it means you'll throw me up on a Reddit post that can get over 100+ responses then maybe I'll have to start doing it! **Disregard the section about asking me to conflict you if you feel uncomfortable debating in front of me since I've judged minimally and don't have any experience judging any of the teams in the field more than once therefore, it doesn't apply to you** 2016-2017 Season Update: September 11, 2016 HS Public Forum Update: This is my first year really becoming involved in Public Forum Debate. I have a lot of strong opinions as far as the activity goes. However, my strongest opinion centers on the way that evidence is used, miscited, paraphrased, and taken out of context during debates. Therefore, I will start by requiring that each student give me a copy of their Pro/Con case prior to their speech and also provide me a copy of all qualified sources they'll cite throughout the debate prior to their introduction. I will proactively fact-check all of your citations and quotations, as I feel it is needed. Furthermore, I'd strongly prefer that evidence be directly quoted from the original text or not presented at all. I feel that those are the only two presentable forms of argumentation in debate. I will not accept paraphrased evidence. If it is presented in a debate I will not give it any weight at all. Instead, I will always defer to the team who presented evidence directly quoted from the original citation. I also believe that a debater who references no evidence at all, but rather just makes up arguments based on the knowledge they've gained from reading, is more acceptable than paraphrasing.  Paraphrasing to me is a shortcut for those debaters who are too lazy to directly quote a piece of text because they feel it is either too long or too cumbersome to include in their case. To me, this is laziness and will not be rewarded.  Beyond that, the debate is open for the debaters to interpret. I'd like if debaters focused on internal links, weighing impacts, and instructing me on how to write my ballot during the summary and final focus. Too many debaters allow the judge to make up their mind and intervene with their own personal inclinations without giving them any guidance on how to evaluate competing issues. Work Hard and I'll reward you. Be Lazy and it won't work out for you. NDT/CEDA Update: I'm getting older and I'm spending increasingly more hours on debate (directing, coaching, and tabulating at the HS and College level) than I used to. I really love the activity of debate, and the argumentative creativity being developed, but I'm slowly starting to grow hatred toward many of the attitudes people are adopting toward one another, which in turn results in me hating the activity a little more each day. I believe the foundational element of this activity is mutual respect amongst competitors and judges. Without this foundational element, the activity is doomed for the future.  As a result, I don't want to be a part of a debate unless the four debaters in the room really want me to be there and feel I will benefit them by judging their debate. I feel debate should be an inclusive environment and each student in the debate should feel comfortable debating in front of the judge assigned to them.  I also don’t want people to think this has to do with any single set of arguments being run. I really enjoy academic debates centered on discussions of the topic and/or resolution. However, I don’t prefer disregarding or disrespectful attitudes toward one another. This includes judges toward students, students toward judges, students toward observers, observers toward students, and most importantly students toward students.   As I grow older my tolerance for listening to disparaging, disregarding, and disrespectful comments from the participants has completely eroded. I'm not going to tolerate it anymore. I got way better things to do with my time than listen to someone talk down to me when I've not done the same to them. I treat everyone with respect and I demand the same in return. I think sometimes debaters, in the heat of competition, forget that even if a judge knows less about their lived/personal experience or hasn’t read as much of their literature as they have; the judges, for the most part, understand how argumentation operates and how debates are evaluated. Too many debaters want to rely on the pref sheet and use it to get judges who will automatically check-in, which is antithetical to debate education. Judges should and do vote for the ""worse"" or ""less true"" arguments in rounds when they were debated better. Debate is a performative/communicative activity. It's not about who wrote the best constructive only. It's about how teams clash throughout the debate.  Therefore, as a result, I will allow any person or team to ask me to conflict them if they feel uncomfortable debating in front of me or feel that the current system of judge placement requires them to prefer me since I'm a better fit than the other judge(s). I won't ask you any questions and won't even respond to the request beyond replying ""request honored"". Upon receiving the request I will go into my tabroom.com account and make sure I conflict you from future events. I feel this way you'll have a better chance at reducing the size of the judge pool and you'll get to remove a judge that you don't feel comfortable debating in front of which will narrow the number of judges available to you and might allow you to get more preferable judges. My email is bmanuel@stanford.edu. Please direct all conflict requests to this email. 2014-2015 Season Update: September 2, 2014 (The gift that keeps on giving!!) The following are not for the faint of heart!  Some days you just can't get ready in the morning without being bothered. Then you just need to be cheered up and it fails or someone threatens to eat your phone. However, when it's all said and done you can at least sleep having sweet dreams. **On a more serious note. Dylan Quigley raised a point on the College Policy Debate Facebook group about what ""competition"" means when people are judging debates. Therefore, I'll go with this answer ""Because this is an emerging debate with no clear consensus, I would encourage judges to let the debaters hash out a theory of competition instead of trying to create one for them. I think in an era where students are taking their power to mold the ""world of debate"" they debate in it is especially important for us judges to *listen* to their arguments and learn from their theories. No shade towards the original post, I just think it's worthwhile to emphasize the relationship between ""new debate"" (whatevs that is) and student's ability to create theories of debate on their own instead of choosing a theory that's imposed on them.""  However, in the absence of these debates happening in the round I will default to a traditional interpretation of ""competition."" This interpretation says the neg must prove their alternative method/advocacy is better than the affirmative method/advocacy or combination of the affirmatives method/advocacy and all or part of the negatives method/advocacy. Also in these situations, I'll default to a general theory of opportunity cost which includes the negative burden of proving the affirmative undesirable.  2013-2014 Season Update: December 25, 2013 (Yes, it's Christmas...so here are your presents!!) If you love to debate as much as Sukhi loves these cups, please let it show!! If you can mimic this stunt, you'll thoroughly impress me and be well rewarded: Sukhi Dance And you thought you had a sick blog!! Also, why cut cards when you can have sick Uke skills like these and these!! To only be shown up by a 2-year-old killing it to Adele Finally, we need to rock out of 2013 with the Stanford version of the Harlem Shake by Sukhi and KJaggz 2012-2013 Season Update: August 22, 2012 Instead of forcing you to read long diatribes (see below) about my feelings on arguments and debate practices. I will instead generate a list of things I believe about debate and their current practices. You can read this list and I believe you'll be able to adequately figure out where to place me on your preference sheet. If you'd like to read more about my feelings on debate, then continue below the fold! Have a great season. 1. TKO is still in play, and will always be that way! 2. You must win a link to a DA - if you don't talk about it I'm willing to assign it zero risk. Uniqueness doesn't mean there is a risk of a link. 2a. ""Issue Specific Uniqueness"" IS NOT a utopian answer to all affirmative arguments. 3. You must defend something on the aff - by doing so it also implies you should be able to defend your epistemological assumptions underlying that advocacy. 4. T is about reasonability, not competing interpretations. This doesn't mean every affirmative is reasonably topical. 5. Debate should be hard; it's what makes it fun and keeps us interested. 6. Research is good - it's rewarding, makes you smarter, and improves your arguments. 7. ""Steal the entire affirmative"" strategies are bad. However, affirmative teams are even worse at calling teams out on it. This means they are still very much in play. Therefore, affirmatives should learn how to defeat them, instead of just believing they'll somehow go away. 8. There are other parts to an argument other than the impact. You should try talking about them, I heard they're pretty cool. 9. Your affirmative should have advantages that are intrinsic to the mechanism you choose to defend with the aff. Refer to #6, it helps solve this dilemma. 10. Have fun and smile! The debaters, judges, and coaches in this activity are your lifelong friends and colleagues. We are all rooting you on to succeed. We all love the activity or we wouldn't be here. If you don't like something, don't hate the player, hate the game! Clipping/Cross-reading/Mis-marking: I hear that this is coming back. To prosecute cheating, the accusing team needs hard evidence. A time trial is not hard evidence. A recording of the speech must be presented. I will stop the debate, listen to the recording, and compare it to the evidence read. If cheating occurred, the offending debater and their partner will receive zero speaker points and a loss. I'd also encourage them to quit. I consider this offense to be more serious than fabricating evidence. It is an honor system that strikes at the very core of what we do here. An additional caveat that was discussed with me at a previous tournament - I believe that the status quo is always a logical option for the negative unless it is explicitly stated and agreed to in CX or it's won in a speech. Newly Updated Philosophy - November 18, 2011 So after talking to Tim Aldrete at USC, he convinced me that I needed more carrots and fewer sticks in my philosophy. Therefore, I have a small carrot for those debaters who wish to invoke it. It's called a T.K.O (Technical Knockout). This basically means that at any point of the debate you believe you've solidly already won the debate, beyond a reasonable doubt, (dropped T argument, double turn, a strategic miscue that is irreparable by the other team) you can invoke a TKO and immediately end the debate. If a team chooses this path and succeeds, I will give them 30 speaker points each and an immediate win. If the team chooses to invoke this but it's unclear you've TKO'd the other team or in fact choose wrong, you obviously will lose and your points will be severely affected. Who dares to take the challenge? Past Updated Philosophy - September 9, 2010 I am currently the Assistant Coach @ Lakeland/Panas High School, College Prep School, and Harvard Debate. I’m also involved with Research & Marketing for Planet Debate. This topic will be my 14th in competitive debate and 10th as a full-time coach. Debate is my full-time job and I love this activity pretty much more than anything I’ve ever done in my life. I enjoy the competition, the knowledge gained, and the people I’ve come to be friends with, and likewise I really enjoy people who have the same passion I have for this activity. I last posted an update to my judge philosophy a number of years ago and think it is finally time I revisit it and make some changes. First, I’ll be the first to admit that I probably haven’t been the best judge the last few years and I think a majority of that has come from pure exhaustion. I’ve been traveling upwards of 20+ weekends a year and am constantly working when I am home. I don’t get much time to re-charge my batteries before I’m off to another tournament. Then while at tournaments I’m usually putting in extremely late nights cutting cards and preparing my teams, which trades off with being adequately awake and tuned in. This year I’ve lessened my travel schedule and plan to be much better rested for debates than I was in previous years. Second, since my earlier days of coaching/judging, my ideology about debate has changed somewhat. This new ideology will tend to complement hard-working teams and disadvantage lazy teams who try and get by with the same generics being run every debate. Don’t let this frighten you, but rather encourage you to become more involved in developing positions and arguments. When this happens I’m overly delighted and reward you with higher speaker points and more than likely a victory. "
"Email: ethan3768@gmail.com Hey! I'm Ethan and I debated for West Broward in Florida for 4 years. I received 9 bids and broke at the TOC. There are a couple of things that generally contextualize my views on debate and how you should probably debate in front of me. I am Tech > Truth. Naturally, if your arguments are both technical and true, that makes you a better debater. Public Forum Emory update - ngl, I want you to read theory in front of me if you understand it. General: I won't evaluate 1] new 2nr arguments and/or implications that directly are used to answer something in the 1ac. Weighing is fine but I will not evaluate arguments that answer something from the 1ac. That means no GSP or skep turns case in the 2nr unless it was in the 1nc. Only exception is if new offense was read in the 1ar. 2] non-sequitur arguments or arguments where conclusions don't follow from premises. 3] won't evaluate speeches early INSIDE of the speech the argument was read in. Yes eval after 2n in 1nc, No eval after 2n in 2n. 4] oppression good in a vacuum. Off limits = racism good. Acceptable but hard to make a good argument = x violence does not happen to y group in z instance. Just be sensitive - pluralist dialogue is important but being mindful of others' feelings is also integral. Theory: One of the things I feel most comfortable evaluating. Coming up with a smart combo shell or making cool strategic decisions are awesome and make judging a lot more fun. I'm perfectly fine with theory as a strategic tool so if this is what you like to do, I'm all for it. There's no such thing as frivolous theory.  Defaults - DTA, Reasonability, No RVIs. NSM vs IRA assumption depends on offense to the shell. These are paradigm issues, not voters. These are the defaults because this is what any paragraph argument on any flow would look like as long as an external impact (fairness, bindingness, scope, etc) is justified. I don’t default voters (Fairness/Ed/Etc) - they’re impacts to arguments. I will assume there’s no impact to the standards if you don't read an external impact. Don't read new paradigm issues for a 1nc shell in the 2n, it's new. T: I view it as an endorsement > punishment model. It's a methods debate so winning the shell is prob enough to independently justify voting on it. These are just defaults if no one reads paradigm issues though. Obviously, I'll evaluate the shell under whatever metric you justify. Policy: I never debated this way but I'll evaluate these debates the way you tell me to. The jargon is not exactly vernacular to me so I'd probably err on the side of explaining the implication of something for like 2 seconds if you think I wouldn't get it. Underrated strategy though against phil debaters and I do like it. Tricks: Sure. I like warrants though. I'm also tired of analytic dumps where arguments are all over the place. Ks: Better off preffing someone else. I'm a sucker for extinction o/w and frankly true arguments that say 1nc evidence has no warrants. If you cut good evidence though, that's solid. Bar for explanation is high and I don't listen to arguments that demean another debater's identity. Theory of power needs to be clear and 2n explanation needs to be found in the 1nc. "
"Jeffrey MillerCurrent Coach -- Marist School (2011-present)Lab Leader -- National Debate Forum (2015-present), Emory University (2016), Dartmouth College (2014-2015), University of Georgia (2012-2015)Former Coach -- Fayette County (2006-2011), Wheeler (2008-2009)Former Debater -- Fayette County (2002-2006) jmill126@gmail.com and maristpublicforum@gmail.com for email chains, please (no google doc sharing and no locked google docs) Last Updated -- 2/12/2012 for the 2022 Postseason (no major updates, just being more specific on items) I am a high school teacher who believes in the power that speech and debate provides students.  There is not another activity that provides the benefits that this activity does. I am involved in topic wording with the NSDA and argument development and strategy discussion with Marist, so you can expect I am coming into the room as an informed participant about the topic. As your judge, it is my job to give you the best experience possible in that round.  I will work as hard in giving you that experience as I expect you are working to win the debate.  I think online debate is amazing and would not be bothered if we never returned to in-person competitions again.  For online debate to work, everyone should have their cameras on and be cordial with other understanding that there can be technical issues in a round.  What does a good debate look like? In my opinion, a good debate features two well-researched teams who clash around a central thesis of the topic.  Teams can demonstrate this through a variety of ways in a debate such as the use of evidence, smart questioning in cross examination and strategical thinking through the use of casing and rebuttals.   In good debates, each speech answers the one that precedes it (with the second constructive being the exception in public forum). Good debates are fun for all those involved including the judge(s). The best debates are typically smaller in nature as they can resolve key parts of the debate.  The proliferation of large constructives have hindered many second halves as they decrease the amount of time students can interact with specific parts of arguments and even worse leaving judges to sort things out themselves and increasing intervention.   What role does theory play in good debates? I've always said I prefer substance over theory.  That being said, I do know theory has its place in debate rounds and I do have strong opinions on many violations.  I will do my best to evaluate theory as pragmatically as possible by weighing the offense under each interpretation.  For a crash course in my beliefs of theory - disclosure is good, open source is an unnecessary standard for high school public forum teams until a minimum standard of disclosure is established, paraphrasing is bad, round reports is frivolous, content warnings for graphic representations is required, content warnings over non-graphic representations is debatable.   All of this being said, I don't view myself as an autostrike for teams that don't disclose or paraphrase.  However, I've judged enough this year to tell you if you are one of those teams and happen to debate someone with thoughts similar to mine, you should be prepared with answers. How do ""progressive"" arguments work in good debates? Like I said above, arguments work best when they are in the context of the critical thesis of the topic.  Thus, if you are reading the same cards in your framing contention from the Septober topic that have zero connections to the current topic, I think you are starting a up-hill battle for yourselves.  I have not been entirely persuaded with the ""pre-fiat"" implications I have seen this year - if those pre-fiat implications were contextualized with topic literature, that would be different.   My major gripe with progressive debates this year has been a lack of clash.  Saying ""structural violence comes first"" doesn't automatically mean it does or that you win.  These are debatable arguments, please debate them.  I am also finding that sometimes the lack of clash isn't a problem of unprepared debaters, but rather there isn't enough time to resolve major issues in the literature.  At a minimum, your evidence that is making progressive type claims in the debate should never be paraphrased and should be well warranted.  I have found myself struggling to flow framing contentions that include four completely different arguments that should take 1.5 minutes to read that PF debaters are reading in 20-30 seconds (Read: your crisis politics cards should be more than one line).  How should evidence exchange work? Evidence exchange in public forum is broken.  At the beginning of COVID, I found myself thinking cases sent after the speech in order to protect flowing.  However, my view on this has shifted. A lot of debates I found myself judging last season had evidence delays after case.  At this point, constructives should be sent immediately prior to speeches.  (If you paraphrase, you should send your narrative version with the cut cards in order).  At this stage in the game, I don't think rebuttal evidence should be emailed before but I imagine that view will shift with time as well.   When you send evidence to the email chain, I prefer a cut card with a proper citation and highlighting to indicate what was read.  Cards with no formatting or just links are as a good as analytics. For what its worth, whenever I return to in-person tournaments, I do expect email chains to continue. What effects speaker points? I am trying to increase my baseline for points as I've found I'm typically below average.  Instead of starting at a 28, I will try to start at a 28.5 for debaters and move accordingly.  Argument selection, strategy choices and smart crossfires are the best way to earn more points with me.  You're probably not going to get a 30 but have a good debate with smart strategy choices, and you should get a 29+.   This only applies to tournaments that use a 0.1 metric -- tournaments that are using half points are bad. "
I am a parent judge so please speak slowly and articulate your arguments clearly. I will try my best to keep track but use numbered responses and label your contentions. List voter issues in summary and final focus for why I should vote for you. Please be respectful and have fun! 
"evamotolinia@lclark.edu and please add blakedocs@googlegroups.com to the chain as well (this is just how Blake keeps track of our chains because otherwise they get lost) TL;DR clean extensions, weighed impacts, and warrant comparison are the easiest way to win my ballot. I debated for 2 years in the UDL at Clara Barton and 4 years in PF at Blake (both in MN). Please don't mistake me for a policy judge, I was only a novice and didn't do any progressive argumentation. My judging style is tech but persuasion is still important. I prefer a team that goes deeper on key issues (in the 2nd half of the debate) rather than going for all offense on the flow. There can/ should be a lot on the flow in the 1st half of the debate but not narrowing it down in summ and FF is extremely unstrategic and trades off with time to weigh your arguments and compare warrants. Use evidence, quote evidence, and we won't have a problem. Don't paraphrase and don't bracket. Bad evidence ethics increases the probability that I will intervene against you, especially in messy debates. I'll start your prep if you take longer than 2 minutes to find and send a card. I don't require it but I do think that 2nd rebuttal should rebuild. Now with the 3 min summary, I think a rebuild in rebuttal is crucial. I am very reluctant to accept a lot of new evidence in the 2nd summary because it pushes the debate back too much. (Note: I still accept a warrant clarification or deepening of a warrant/ analysis because that is separate from brand new evidence.) Defense needs to be in first summary. With 3 minutes, summaries don't have an excuse anymore to be mediocre. Bottom Line: If it is not in summary then it cannot be in final focus. If it is not in final focus then I will not vote on it. In order to win, you gotta weigh. The earlier you start the weighing, the better. I don't like new mechanisms in 2nd FF (1st FF is still a bit sketch. I am fine with timeframe, magnitude, probability new in the 1st FF but prereque should probably come sooner). The 2nd speaking summary has a big advantage so I don't accept that there is no time to weigh. It is fine if the summary speaker introduces quick weighing and the final focus elaborates on it in final focus (especially for 1st summary). If both teams are weighing, tell me which is the preferable weighing mechanism. Same for framework. Competing frameworks with no warrant for why to prefer either one becomes useless and I will pick the framework that is either cleanly extended or that I like better. I vote on warrants and CLEAN extensions. A proper extension in the 2nd half of the round is the card name, the content of the card and the implication of the card. Anything short of this is a blippy extension, meaning I give it less weight during my evaluation of the flow. Name of the card is the least important part of the extension for me so don't get too caught up on that, it will just help me find the card on the flow. I vote on the path of least resistance, if possible. That means that I am more inclined to vote on a dropped turn than messy case offense. But turns need to be implicated, I won't vote on a turn with no impact. Additionally, a link without an impact is useless. So is an impact without a link. Even if your opponent drops something, you still have to do a full extension (it can be quicker still but I don't accept blippy extensions). You can speak fast, but I would like a warning. If you plan on going REALLY fast, any participant in the room can say ""slow"" or ""clear"" because speed is fine but fairness is more important. Also, the faster you speak, the less I will get on the flow. Just because I am a tech judge, does not mean I am able to type at godly speeds. Don't sacrifice persuasion, clarity, or argumentation for speed otherwise, it will be counterproductive for the debate and (possibly) your speaker points. With the new online format, sending a speech doc (before or after the speech) does not mean that you can be incomprehensible. I still need to be able to understand you verbally, I will not follow the speech doc during your speech. I am still learning when it comes to judging/ evaluating theory and Ks. I am more familiar with ROB but still need a slower debate with clear warranting. I am more familiar with Ks than theory but never debated either so the concepts are taking me longer to internalize. You can run it in front of me but combining it with speed makes me even more confused. In short, theory is a bit of a gamble with me. I understand a lot of basic ideas when it comes to theory argumentation but your warranting and extensions will have to be even more explicit for me to keep up. Also, be nice to each other (but a little sass never hurt anyone). Still, be cognizant of how much leeway you have with sass based on power dynamics and the trajectory of the round/ tone of the room. Sass does not mean bullying. Sometimes messy rounds will come down to nitpicky things so here are some clarifications: Warranted Cards > warranted analytics > unwarranted cards > unwarranted analytics Qualified source and author > qualified source only> qualified author only > no qualified author or source Link +impact extension > Link with no impact > impact with no link Comparative weighing > weighing that is only about your impact > weighing that is about opponents impact only I only have this list because some rounds have come down to each team doing one of these things so this list explains where/ how I intervene when I need to resolve a clash of arguments that were not resolved in the debate. If the tournament allows, I like to disclose and have a discussion about the round after I submit my ballot. Ask me any questions before or after the round. "

I am a lay judge who prefers to see clear and persuasive arguments that convince me to vote for you. 
"I have been judging PF for a little over two years now. I am a scientist at heart. So it should make sense that in order to evaluate your arguments I need to understand them. This is PF, not LD and that should mean something to you. I want to hear well-warranted arguments supported by evidence extended and explained in rebuttals. You need to weigh with rationale and impacts. Everything in the final focus should be said in summary. Be respectful to one another and to me. Be polite in the crossfire. You should learn something new in every round and remember to have fun. As a side note, I am here to judge the resolution. I will not listen or judge side topics or arguments. Do not bring your own agenda into the round, specifically I am not judging your critique of debate theory.  "
"Email: spencer.orlowski@gmail.com  please add me to the email chain   New Paradigm 9/16/21  I have voted on pretty much everything. I prefer depth and clash to running from debate. Engaging will be rewarded.  Don’t be a jerk to your opponent or me. We are all giving up lots of free time to be here. I won't vote on oppressive arguments. I think preparation is the cornerstone of the value this activity offers. The more theory you read, the lower your speaker points will be. Obviously there are some rounds when you have to, but you shouldn’t rely on theory to avoid reading. Topicality is not the same thing as theory.   I don't think it’s possible to be tab, but I try not to intervene. Arguments must have a warrant or they aren’t an argument. This applies to all debate styles. (Ex. 4-6-3 is not a full argument)  I shouldn’t have to have background on your argument to understand it. I understand a lot, but that will be irrelevant to my decision. I won’t fill in gaps for you. I think most debates are way closer and more subjective than people give them credit for. Collapsing is a good idea given all of the above comments. I will not flow off the doc - if you choose to spread in a way I can't hear you risk me missing the argument.  FOR PF: I did PF for 4 years in HS and I currently coach it. I flow a lot. Any argument you want in the second FF should be in the 2nd Summary. The first summary doesn't need to extend defense as long as the second rebuttal didn't respond to it. I think the 2nd rebuttal should probably respond to the first, just seems strategic. I read a lot on each topic and will hold you to a standard of accuracy for the most part. Speaker points are based on skill in crossfire, strategy of collapse, and quality of evidence. If it takes you longer than a min to produce evidence, it doesn't exist. If I think you inappropriately paraphrased I will ignore evidence. Read cards to avoid me thinking your paraphrasing is bad. I will vote on theory and Ks.  "
"I am a parent judge, you may send me cases @ neemaspatel7@gmail.com if possible before the round, this will benefit your speaks I flow arguments to the best of my ability so my understanding of your arguments is critical to your success. I am not a lay judge, here are some guidelines for success: 1) You can speak fast, but please be clear. 2) Just because I am a parent judge does not mean you can forget about warrants. If you want me to buy an argument, I need to know why it is true, on all levels of responses not just your case. Do not just make claims and expect me to buy it. 3) Handle your own time and prep. Create a way of evidence sharing before the round start time and add me to whatever the two teams decide, a google doc, or email chain, unless you are sharing the cards in person. 4) Be respectful to me and your opponents, any form of inappropriate behavior will result in an automatic loss and the lowest speaks I can give you. "
"I have judged speech and debate events for the past 13 years. My son was in Congress. General thoughts Regardless of the event, I expect professionalism and preparation from all competitors. Showing up unprepared or engaging in unprofessional behavior wastes your time, my time, as well as that of the other competitors and your coaches. Public Forum Debate & LD Although I’ve judged PFD more than LD, I feel comfortable with both events. I appreciate assertiveness but actively dislike aggression. Clarity is extremely important. Don’t be cocky: instead, try to convey how deeply you’ve researched the topic. I always leave my personal opinions on the topic aside in order to be fair to all debaters. Interp/speech I started off my judging career judging interp, even though lately I’ve been judging debate more. Regardless of the piece, you have to give your best when performing. Delivery must always be clear and interesting. Tech should be smooth and reflect the norms of the event itself (tech in DI is very different than tech in HI). "
"The following paradigm is fairly exhaustive because my investment as a judge is equally (if not more) important than what y’all do as competitors. If my feedback is subpar, the work and effort you all put in is a waste. Ultimately, the following novel is not meant to intimidate, but rather to aid in how the debate can be elevated. I look forward to being a part of the art of communication through debate in each round and best of luck! General Background: I am the assistant debate and forensics coach at the University of Richmond, where I also obtained a B.A. in Philosophy. I have over ten years of experience as a competitor and four as a collegiate coach in six styles of debate (PF, LD, Policy, Congress, Parliamentary, and Long Table) and over a dozen speech events. I competed with and against international teams that are a part of the CIDD and German circuits and am a member of the VAFTDC (Virginia Association of Forensics, Theatre, and Debate Coaches). Additionally, I have/had involvement with Future Problem Solvers, Model UN, theatre, and improv. Given the scope of my background, a lot of my preferences concentrate on the art of rhetoric and communication within debate rather than a purely technical focus (truth>tech). That said, I try to also respect the difference between norms and rules given the breadth of the debate realm and appreciate the evolving structure of the debate realm. Feel free to e-mail me any questions: zachary.e.perry@gmail.com Main Paradigm: Kindness is key. The purpose of debate is to expand upon ideas with good faith intentions and find ways to coherently communicate and critique nuanced topics. That said, there are certain truths that are generally held to be accepted as true (things should be logically consistent, all people should be treated with humanely, opinions cannot replace facts though can be considered as informing perspective and bias, etc.). Especially given the current political climate, a healthy level of skepticism and grace should always be extended without resorting to ad hom attacks or broad sweeping generalizations. This guiding principle is something that can be utilized throughout our existence, which is what makes debating so valuable as a life skill. I am sick of wasting time during round calling for cards. I believe in disclosure theory which means if your case is not presented in full and a card is asked for, I am immediately running prep. Extinction arguments (re: nuclear war) are a losing battle and while it is not a guaranteed loss, know that we live in a world where that it is so statistically unlikely, it does not provide a compelling argument. Death is not a threat if it is inevitable, it's the suffering that we fear. If you're going to run existential cases, you're better off pointing to cyber warfare, anti-capitalism/totalitarianism, or human rights cases since that has more tangible, concrete impacts. Yes, death is a major factor to consider, but I don't lose sleep over it considering that we live in a capitalist hellscape that makes existence make death seem like an escape. Some things of note: -Avoid personal phrases. Frame things as an objective pontification instead with “if/then” statements and “the affirmative/negative’s position claims…” -Be honest about mistakes both in ownership and forgiveness. If a point is dropped, concede and find ways to move forward. Additionally, don’t take critiques personally and recognize the difference between norms and rules. It may impact the debate scoring or decision depending on how egregious the instance is. Debate is a holistically judged sport! -Clarity is key. Making assumptions leads to a lot of miscommunication and though I may have experience in a lot of different backgrounds, I am human as well. Revel in the fact that you are the go-to expert in the room! -Organization helps with everyone. Signposting and roadmaps are highly encouraged. Roadmaps are also more than just saying you’ll “touch upon the opponent’s contentions and expanding upon your own”. Being able to identify features of clash, impact calculus, voters, and what kind of debate it is (value, definition, evidence, contention, etc.) will help elevate the overall effect of presentation. Other: Case Sharing and Sources/Citations- It is not required to share the entire case with the opponent. However, it is in good faith to at least allow access to specific portions used and it is mandatory to share cards when asked. Though I do not like evidence shoving and card-based debates, it does not look favorable if you cannot provide adequate support of a claim. Sourcing is also important and when giving a piece of evidence, understanding the methodology and ideas of empiricism and epistemology are key in demonstrating an adequate understanding of the citations provided. Speaker Points (from a 20-30 scale)- I rank on a bell curve structure that is fairly reflective of the indicated suggested ranking (poor, average, good, excellent, and outstanding). This may skew points in overall standing but also indicates that a score of 29 or 30 is truly earned. As long as the argument is clear (organizationally and orally), use up the majority of the time, are able to identify each necessary piece (value, VC, and contentions), the score should range from 23-27 based on other factors such as fillers (“uh” and “um”), dropped arguments, rebuttals, and overall ability to crystalize the argument. Rarely will I award anything lower than 22 unless the speeches are incomplete, there is a conduct issue, or the debate is entirely just conceded. Conversely, scores in the upper echelon effectively demonstrate mastery of presentation (little to no fillers, solid stance and projection of voice, able to command the room without seeming too aggressive), expansive understanding of the topic at hand and evidence presented (clean links and warrant), and excelling at the art of rhetoric and argumentation theory via things such as voters, impact calculus, and word economy. Know that if you obtain a score of 28 or above, I am genuinely impressed! DEBATE  Lincoln-Douglas: Key judging elements I look for: Value/VC, Definitions, Framework, Theory, Analysis, CX, CBA Plans, Kritiks (K), Fiats, and Theory- Though I recognize the validity (and growing usage) of “progressive” LD, I tend to follow a more traditional outline. I think plans and Kritiks (Ks) have their place as long as they don’t deviate too far from the topic at hand and provide explicit tie into solvency, inherency, and the overall framework/paradigm at hand. Your plan should also FOLLOW the establishment of contentions and general framework. PRE-Fiats also tend to be used in ways to derail the debate by completing sidelining the resolution at hand. POST-Fiats are totally fair game as long as it is still relevant and topical. The structure should not hinge upon a theory argument considering that the Value/VC is contingent. IMPORTANT NOTE: If you run a plan that indicates we should ignore philosophical/moral theories in favor of political and pragmatic ones (there is a painful irony within this notion)  or appeal to theory as an end-all-be-all (save for very VERY limited exceptions), I will automatically dismiss your case. This is a particular problem because I have seen a butchered interpretation of some major theorists despite having good intentions. That said, it does no good to spread misinformation and accountability of knowledge is of utmost importance. In short, all politics is based off of theory, and using Rawls’ “original position” and “veil of ignorance” does not necessarily absolve you of that burden just because some antiquated dead white dude said it’s possible to be enlightened while conveniently ignoring the fact that We Live In A Society™. I also do not have the patience for Ks that purport a resolution being dismissed on the notion that it's inherently ""racist, sexist, queercist, ableist, etc"". We exist on a platform that is intrinsically rooted in privilege and if you're going to push an Oppression Olympics argument, no one wins and it defeats the purpose of debate. We all have something to learn through our own personal adversity and it is not productive discounting a person's opinion solely because they may be more or less privileged than you. Extinction arguments are also extremely annoying and offer nothing unique or interesting to the debate since it assumes a fallacious slippery slope scenario that is almost never rooted in reality.  That said; use all of these suggestions at your own discretion. Framework, Paradigms/Observations, Disadvantages (Disads), and Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBA)-  FRAMEWORK IS IMPERATIVE. If you do not give definitions, context, paradigms and/or observations, you leave the debate wide open for attacks or gaps to be filled either by the opponent or my own implicit biases. I will do my best to remain objective but if certain norms are expected, I will default to my own inferences of the topic at hand. Paradigms are important for context and should be given if the resolution is vague. For instance, is this topic Americentric or global? What is the status quo? Is there a timeframe? Though not necessary, those that include a sort of paradigm or observation within their framework generally tend to fare better. Remember what happens when people assume things :) Disads are also helpful when identified adequately for the rebuttal and rejoinder speeches. For me, CBA should be a general default when debating a topic. Debate is about exploring the nuances of the argument since most things are not black and white. Do not assume (again, there’s that word), my background in Philosophy means I favor a political or social case over an economic one. If one side demonstrates favorable merit and a cleaner link to the resolution at hand, it does not matter what flavor of argument is presented. I will vote and have voted for arguments that go against my own personal beliefs if/when they are conveyed well. Flex Prep/CX Flow- I allow Flex Prep (shifting prep time for CX time) but only if both parties agree to its usage before the round starts through explicit consent. Additionally, I DO flow CX since I think it has a purpose in the debate and demonstrates a person’s ability to elevate the contentions. A good CX can make or break a round and help give additional points based on oratory skills. Roadmaps/Signposting- Please use them and refer to the main paradigm section above. Public Forum: Key judging elements I look for: Definitions, Framework, Analysis, crossfire, CBA, well-composed rebuttal, summary, and final focus speeches The use of spreading, plans, and Kritiks (Ks) are antithetical to PF debate given the fact that it is understood as the most accessible form of argumentation to a layperson. That said, there should be heavy emphasis on analysis and warrant and not just evidence shoving. Given the rapid back and forth of this style of debate, the expectation is to be a kind of “mini-expert” of a topic with an intimate understanding of certain terms and elements related to the resolution and disseminated quickly. CBA is expected though not always necessary depending on the resolution. Definitions- these are imperative for framework. If you do not define the scope and context of this debate, it is impossible to create a basis for why the contentions uphold the resolution. I DO FLOW AND HEAVILY WEIGH CROSSFIRES. The main appeal and, imo, fun part of PF is the “real world” aspect of having a rapid back and forth conversation. A person’s ability to adequately talk about a controversial topic with a level head means just as much as being “right” about a situation or topic. Given how most constructive cases are prepared, the main weighing mechanism for me is how well people can utilize impact calculus (magnitude, feasibility, timeframe, and probability) and voters (evidence weighing, contention clash, definition debate) by the end of the debate. The best debates are those who are able to find the common thread and main clash of the debate (usually by establishing a CBA). Policy: Key judging elements I look for: Plan building, heavy evidence usage, links/warrants/analysis Policy, to me, is what the highest and most refined debate should be. Pulling from all other disciplines (the oratory, bill building, and procedural skills of Congress, the theory and analysis skills of LD, the evidence and case building of PF, and the impromptu style of Parli and Long Table). Any and all aspects of the above topics are fair game as long as it’s in good faith. Though policy is, admittedly, my least favorite and least familiar debate style, I appreciate the craft and some of my favorite rounds have been in policy though it is a beast to understand and an even bigger feat to master so hats off to those who compete in one of the most profound forms of debate! Spreading- Please do not spread. The art of debate is about communication and a person’s ability to have an impressive wpm does not promote adequate expansion of complex ideas and is antithetical to the spirit of argumentation. I will doc points if I cannot flow properly due to speaking too quickly. If I cannot physically fully follow the argument, I cannot award adequate points. Congress: The quote, ""Politics is perception"" is especially true for this form of debate. The showmanship and ability to present a topic in only three minutes is a powerful tool that is heavily based on the speaking style and engagement with the entire chamber. The focus on evidence is not as important but I typically look for at least one source per contention. I only recommend one since I think that the quality of analysis is more important than the quantity of sources. Being able to address the bill or resolution specifically will also elevate the overall impression and score. Back and forth debate is obviously the ideal though as long as it's not too lopsided, I don't mind doubling of one side occasionally. As long as people are respectful and communicative without stepping on too many toes, I'm a fairly lax judge. From a Parliamentarian's standpoint, being able to take up space confidently without suffocating the room is a delicate balancing act. Being eager to participate without stifling others is also key in the communal aspect of Congress. Efficient chambers are nice, but if the room becomes too tense, it sucks all the joy out of the event. PO scores tend to be a bit more inflated due to the extra burden of tasks though top scores almost always come from those who given incredible speeches. Parliamentary: Given the nature of Parli debate, it is understood that pretty much anything goes. The notion of this debate is meant to be elevated but also accessible so I don't have as many constraints considering the (assumed) maturity of collegiate level debate. That said, I do like to see a person's ability to merge the ability of a solid orator with that of a logical common thread. Though I try to remain unbiased, I will also be tempted to fill in gaps if references are made without adequate sourcing due to the nature of this debate. QUOTE ROUND: I'm fine with either leaning into the resolution from a literal interp of a quote or a broader context of what certain norms and systems mean through theory and storytelling. Use your own discretion. Other notes: I have a humanities degree so advanced econ theory and neuroscience is probably going to go over my head (though I will give it the good old college try!). International Politics is also not something I'm particularly well-versed in. I am but one human on a planet of almost 8 billion with over 200 municipalities. Please hold my hand through your thought process. Speech: General Note: Though my first love was debate, I am a speech kid at heart. The variety and depth is vast and I don't claim to be an expert in any of these individual events. While I think characterization and textual analysis are key to making a piece ""come to life"", I also appreciate the vast amount of perspectives and lived experiences in how we understand narratives. That said, I am entitled to use my own discretion and I as an audience member have a role in your performance. If I am not engaged or not ""included"" in the process of creating this art, it will reflect in the score with reasons that should at least be acknowledged. My aim is not to crush anyone's creative spirit though sometimes certain artistic choices can have consequences that need to be considered (swearing, content choice, general presentation, decorum, etc). We're all human though accountability is of utmost importance. Self-published pieces are... risky especially since the purpose of an ""interp"" is to interpret ANOTHER'S work. Though that isn't to say it doesn't come without potential reward. Be wise. Prose: I'm literate. I love books. Words make me feel things. Bear in mind this event is less about acting and more about textual painting. I should be able to feel your characterization by your tonal inflection and wordplay and appreciate the unpacking of what the author intended blended with your own interpretation. I have a nuanced opinion about Death of the Author so don't assume I'm going to discount the context of the piece just because you have a new spin on it. Honor the work you're presenting, even if it means being subversive with the text. Poetry: Same as prose but, like, poetry, maaaan. I do permit passages from different languages! Just note that the work needed to convey emotion is harder, though not impossible! Please don't just sing a song ???? Duo: My favorite event! This is probably the most theatrical so whether you make me laugh, cry, or just think a little bit more about life, give me a show! Physicality is key. Don't just create a character, BECOME them! Creative use of limited space is key and really try and create dynamic movement not only through your movements, but through the text itself. DI: Duo... but solo Declamation: I don't mind if you try to embody the original intent or put your own spin on it but it should reflect the words spoken in some meaningful way. This event is the most text heavy so be EXTREMELY purposeful in delivery. I couldn't care less about physicality, just make sure to project. Informative: Make me think! I want to be able to take away at least one new fact from the speech. Though logos is the main focus here, there should be a heavy emphasis on sourcing and ethos as well. That said, evidence pushing only goes so far so analysis and warrant should carry your argument forward throughout the presentation. If I lose sight of the thesis, then the overall presentation falls with it. Make sure to establish a common thread and not make it too dry. There should be little to NO opinions in this event save for polls or other pertinent information regarding the event. My role is to learn about the topic, not be persuaded. Persuasive: Though this event is rooted in a lot of elements similar to informative, you should at least convince me to see the validity in your argument even if I don't think it's entirely sound from my own personal opinion. Pathos will also take you far here so definitely appeal to personal anecdotes or other emotional appeals that pair well with the logos and ethos elements in this event. This is meant to be a blended event and showcase your oration skills outside of just presenting an idea. Think TedTalk. Communication Analysis (CA): I tend to find this event a middle ground of persuasive and informative that is pinpointing a specific event or speech at hand. I should be able to follow along with the topic if I don't have any prior knowledge while still being able to be on your side by the end of the speech in some way, shape, or form. This tends to be a really dry event so feel free to spice it up with a few jokes. I like to think of John Oliver, Contrapoints, and Lindsey Ellis as good reference points for CAs on topic areas. Original Oratory: No matter what emotion you make me feel, I should sense it to be genuine AND relatable. OO is one of the hardest because not every story is able to fulfill both requirements and is extremely subjective. I don't have any other feedback other than making sure the narrative is cohesive and follows some sort of the hero's journey. You are the hero, make me want to root you want! Radio Broadcasting: All about the diction, inflection, and personality. This event is incredible because looks truly don't matter. I find the funnier, the better since most RB voices tend to be drab and have a grating sense of braggadocio that is off-putting. Larger than life doesn't have to mean phony so make it BIG but believable. Impromptu: I recommend no more than 2 minutes for prep for top speaks. I'm not entirely impressed by minimal note usage since it's a tool given to you for a reason. Careful about fillers and make sure to have some sort of methodical and cohesive narrative or thesis statement. If I suspect you're using stock stories and inserting the topic as a buzzword, I WILL immediately dock points and recommend disqualification if confirmed. This is not a prepped round and it antithetical to the purpose of the event and I consider it a form of cheating. I hate cheating. Extemporaneous: I recommend at least two sources per point to have a good qualifying score. That said, evidence pushing will only get you so far and I'm far more impressed by a solid analysis of the information presented. The expectation is that you're the mini-expert for 7 minutes and should be able to adequately inform me of a topic in the allotted time (within reason). That said, don't assume I know the context of the topic or that either of us are the smartest person in the room. The event is meant to humble us and designed to force us to appreciate complex topics that need to be handled with care. Hot takes are entertaining but may not always be effective. Use discretion. Overall, I'm excited to be a part of the artistic process and look forward to hearing all of your pieces and speeches!! "
"Debated nationally for 3 years and made quarterfinals at the TOC if you care about that. Put me on the email chain: drewpeterson2002@gmail.com Please send a speech doc before you speak. Please - it will make me very happy and avoid me being very annoyed from taking time to find cards. Please. Disclosure and reading from cut cards = slight speaker point bump - here is a guide Impact calc can be the most important, but in the large majority of the decisions that I make it is not nearly as important as it should be since the weighing is not comparative. No new weighing in second final. Don't weigh just for the sake of weighing by throwing out some terms. Instead, make a real comparative analysis of why I should prefer your argument. Warrants always beat taglines. I prefer hearing smart arguments over a large quantity of them. Argument spin I could clearly see coming is not new. The second rebuttal doesn't have to answer anything but the first final can definitely extend dropped defense from rebuttal. However, all of my rules and preferences are negotiable. If you win that these should be changed and that as I judge I should view the round in a different light, then I will do it. Go for any type of argument as long as you explain it (theory, k's, etc). Please ask me questions about my decision, I'll be more than happy to answer them and it will actually be nice to know you care about the round - postround me for all I care it won't upset me. "
"LES PHILLIPS NUEVA PF PARADIGM I have judged all kinds of debate for decades, beginning with a long career as a circuit policy and LD coach. Speed is fine. I judge on the flow. Dropped arguments carry full weight. At various times I have voted (admittedly, in policy) for smoking tobacco good, Ayn Rand Is Our Savior, Scientology Good, dancing and drumming trumps topicality, and Reagan-leads-to-Communism-and-Communism-is-good. (I disliked all of these positions.) If an argument is in final focus, it should be in summary; if it's in summary, it should be in rebuttal,.  I am very stingy regarding new responses in final focus. Saying something for the first time in grand cross does not legitimize its presence in final focus. NSDA standards demand dates out loud on all evidence. That is a good standard; you must do that. I am giving up on getting people to indicate qualifications out loud, but I am very concerned about evidence standards in PF (improving, but still not good).   I will bristle and/or throw my pen if I hear ""according to Princeton"" as a citation.  Know who your authors are; know what their articles say; know their warrants.  Please please terminalize impacts. Do this especially when you are talking about a nebulosity called ""The Economy.""  Economic growth is not intrinsically good; it depends on where the growth goes and who is helped. Sometimes economic growth is very bad. ""Increases tensions"" is not a terminal impact; what happens after the tensions increase?  When I consider which makes the world a better place, I will be looking for prevention of unnecessary death and/or disease, who lifts people out of poverty, who lessens the risk of war, who prevents gross human rights violations.  I'm also receptive to well-developed framework arguments that may direct me to some different decision calculus. LES PHILLIPS NUEVA PARLI PARADIGM I have judged all kinds of debate for decades, beginning with a long career as a circuit policy and LD coach. I have judged parli less than other formats, but my parli judging includes several NPDA tournaments, including two NPDA national tournaments. Speed is fine, as are all sorts of theoretical, Kritikal, and playfully counterintuitive arguments. I judge on the flow. Dropped arguments carry full weight. I do not default to competing interpretations, though if you win that standard I will go there. The texts of advocacies are binding; slow down for these, as necessary. Ask me questions! Please please terminalize impacts. Do this especially when you are talking about The Economy. ""Helps The Economy"" is not an impact. Economic growth is not intrinsically good; it depends on where the growth goes and who is helped. Sometimes economic growth is very bad. ""Increases tensions"" is not a terminal impact; what happens after the tensions increase? LES PHILLIPS NUEVA LD PARADIGM For years I coached and judged fast circuit LD, but I have not judged LD since 2013, and I have not coached on the current topic at all. Top speed, even if you're clear, may challenge me; lack of clarity will be very unfortunate. I try to be a blank slate (like all judges, I will fail to meet this goal entirely). I like the K, though I get frustrated when I don't know what the alternative is (REJECT is an OK alternative, if that's what you want to do). I have a very high bar for rejecting a dcebater rather than an argument, and I do not default to competing interpretations; I would like to hear a clear abuse story. I am generally permissive in re counterplan competitiveness and perm legitimacy. RVIs are OK if the abuse is clear, but if you would do just as well to simply tell me why the opponent's argument is garbage, that would be appreciated. "
"MBA 21’, Emory 25' Please put me on the email chain: donpierce2025@gmail.com and debatemba@gmail.com. Tech > Truth I primarily ran and debated against policy arguments, but I will do my best to follow along to any argument that is made. That being said, if the argument has not been explained to the point where I would feel comfortable explaining why I am voting for it at the end of the round, I am not going to vote on it. My ballot generally will start with framing/impact calc and/or framework, where you should be comparing/debating out both which sides framing is better and what that means for my ballot. This sets a threshold for what I should look for on the other pages and minimizes intervention. I can be convinced to build offense from the bottom up, meaning I consider each level of offense as a yes/no question and then consider who access more offense at the end of that chain and then do framing/framework/impact calc, but that is not my default. Policy The most important things: Theory---I will be fine if you want to go for theory but please slow down on it especially if you don't send analytics in the speech doc. Outside of conditionality, I generally don’t think theory arguments are reasons to reject the team, and it would be difficult to persuade me to vote on it. Ks---you can read Ks in front of me but do not use excessive jargon or just assume that I understand the underlying theory. The framework debate is often ignored or not fleshed out, which means I generally have to give the aff their plan and the k their links. K affs---I am not going to be your best judge. I think fairness is an impact. Other things: CPs---they are great. If you say judge kick and say I could in the 2nr, you should do that impact calc/framing for both a ballot with the cp + da and da + case defense. Generally speaking, I think the literature determines which counterplans are legitimate and which aren’t, but I can be persuaded that against that DAs---also great. DA plus case is an underrated strategy vs bad affs. Ts---a good T debate is really fun to listen to, but it requires a lot of judge instruction in order to not intervene. PF I have no background in PF. My policy paradigm will help shed light on what I have the best background on, content wise, but ultimately, I am fairly open to anything. Given my lack of background in the activity, I will need more explanation on arguments/acronyms that are isolated to the activity. I flow closely and track argument consistency throughout the round. If the argument you are going for is brand new in your last speech, I will be very skeptical of it. "
"LASA 21, Emory 25 He/Him Put me on the email chain: poedebatedocs@gmail.com  A lot of my thoughts on debate were influenced by Yao Yao Chen and Mason Marriott-Voss, so check out their paradigms. My thoughts on debate are basically the same as Dhruv Ruttala's. The average speaker points I've given on the water topic (in varsity) are 28.76. (updated post-Pine Crest) TLDR I'm fine with both policy and K strats, but I'd rather hear a specific strategy than generics. I think research is the most important part of debate. I try to be tech>truth but I'm inherently skeptical of garbage arguments. Speed is fine if you're clear. Have good disclosure. Don't say stuff that's racist/sexist/homophobic/ableist etc. (but also don't accuse the other team of doing this if they didn't.) Theory If the abuse is egregious I'll 100% vote on theory. 2-3 condo worlds is probably fine, but I lean aff on condo past that. Well researched strategies and specific solvency advocates help the neg win theory. Lean neg: most agent CPs, advantage CPs, PICs out of something in the plan, any CPs recut from aff ev, basically anything with an aff-specific solvency advocate. Lean aff: generic process CPs, kicking planks, 2NC CPs, CPs with no solvency advocate, CPs that only compete textually. Topicality I think about T in a more truth>tech way than I do other arguments. Have specific case lists, examples of ground loss, and a qualified interp that's somewhat contextual to the topic. ""More affs bad"" isn't enough. Policy Affs Have an actual solvency advocate. I prefer specific impact scenarios like ""these countries go to war"" over something like ""democracy solves everything!"" Neg teams should do case debate. I'm frustrated by shallow framing debates. I'll be less frustrated if you contextualize framing to your aff's body of literature. Counterplans Case-specific CPs > generics. Big fan of advantage CPs. If your CP steals the aff to get a contrived internal net benefit, it's an uphill battle to beat the perm. Have a solvency advocate in the 1NC. Disads Good spin and story is more important than dumping 50 cards and hoping I'll sort them out. I prefer DAs based on the outcome of the plan rather than the process, but I'm way more down for politics DAs based on stuff like political capital than I am for bad Rider DAs. 0% risk is possible. Kritiks Have specific links and explain how the K solves/turns the aff. Generic state bad or cruel optimism links aren't persuasive. I've got a high bar for winning structural arguments, but if you explain your structural argument convincingly and apply it to the aff I'll vote for it. I lean toward thinking the neg should have links to the plan or the 1AC's core ideas (which could still include reps, but is less likely to include ""your author defended a concept we don't like in an unhighlighted part of the card."") I start the debate assuming the aff gets the plan, but you can change my mind. Don't overcomplicate alt explanations. Tell me what it really does and give examples if possible. Alts that do something material > alts that think really hard. Kritikal Affs Explain what your aff does and why it matters. It should be clearly related to the topic, not just a previous year's aff with one topic-adjacent card. You should clearly defend something and be stuck with defending it. It's hard to win that your performance of the aff actually did something unless your evidence is fantastic. Neg teams should try to engage with the content of the aff, but I get it if you can't. I'm often persuaded by presumption. K v K debates are awesome, but only if both sides know what's going on. Framework Clash/Research > ""fairness because fairness."" I enjoy creative styles of framework like ""T - literally just talk about the topic at all."" Do the internal link work - tell me the ground you lost, why it's good, etc. Explain the types of debates that would happen in the world of the TVA if you want to go for it. "
"Background I've done debate for five years, with just over four years of that in Public Forum. I've also had limited exposure to Policy debate. However, I may not have had time to research the resolution, so do not assume I have extensive knowledge on the topic. Public Forum Paradigm I am a firm believer in evidence ethics. I strongly dislike paraphrased evidence. It's very easy to misconstrue evidence in round, especially under standard time constraints. From past experience both as a debater and a judge, I've encountered numerous cases of paraphrased evidence being used as a cover for faulty logic or distorting the source material. The best way to present your evidence is reading the cut card verbatim. If I ever suspect that evidence is being misconstrued, I will call for it after the round. Even if your opponent didn't call it out in round, I will drop any card that I believe clearly violates evidence ethics. To maintain evidence ethics, I'm open to allowing card calling off-time, if both sides are fine with it. Speak at a reasonable speed. Speaking fast is fine, as long as you are speaking clearly. I don't like full-on spreading in public forum, but I will flow your speech either way. No theory, Ks, plans, or any of that - I will not flow them. Public Forum is designed to be accessible, and even as a flow judge familiar with these concepts, I will not tolerate them in PF. I would discourage framework debates as well; if you think that you can only win your case based off of some random weighing mechanism or definition that you cherry picked to fit your arguments, you should probably rethink your case. Focus on the arguments, not on technicalities. Generally I will pay close attention to, but will not flow cross examinations. The only exception is that any concessions made in cross will be upheld for the rest of the round. Cross will mainly be used to show me which arguments to focus on, as well as speaks. Summary speech should primarily be used for collapsing. Final focus should primarily be used for weighing. If you want access to an impact, extend it through summary, or I will assume that you kicked out of it. Clash your arguments. Don't just explain to me why you're right, explain to me why your opponents are wrong and especially why your opponents' refutations are wrong. I want to hear real responses, not just canned arguments you had in your block file or extensions through ink. Logical responses are fine, but carded responses are better. I have a short tolerance for logical leaps, so if you want to use logic use it wisely. Between a carded argument and a logical argument, I will almost always prefer the card unless there is an adequate enough explanation to convince me otherwise. I'm very open to unique arguments even if they're extreme, so long as you can back it with a solid link chain. Poorly devised unique arguments should be avoided for any judge. I don't necessarily weigh probability over magnitude, so you have some leeway for unique arguments. First speakers, try to make yourself useful during grand cross! I've seen a lot of rounds where the first speaker just sits mute after summary and the second speaker has to take over instead of using the time to prep for final focus. Keep composure during crossfire. Be polite and professional all around for a good round and good speaks. "
"Was in PF for 3 years and I competed on the local and national circuit. Flow judge. I will always evaluate the framework first and then look towards who best provides offense under the framework. PLEASE COLLAPSE, going for everything in round takes away from your ability to provide a narrative for your arguments. I will only vote on an argument if it’s present in both summary and final focus. That means extending both the warrant, giving a detailed analysis, and the impacts of the argument. Extending card tags alone is not enough. Most importantly, Weigh. If neither of the teams weigh, I’ll be forced to intervene and determine what I think is more important, which you might not necessarily agree with in the end. On a final note, I'm a stickler with evidence, meaning I appreciate evidence that explicitly says what it is that you are trying to communicate in the round; I appreciate logical analysis as well, but there are some instances where having both may serve to benefit you. Probably didn't cover everything so feel free to ask any specific questions before the round. "
"PF Paradigm 2021-22 Season: eDebate - Year of the Delta Variant  I consider myself tech>truth but I have been approaching a closer equilibrium between the two lately due to the poor state of evidence ethics, power tagging, clipping, and more. Further, after two years of COVID debate I especially feel not only the soul of debate but the fun of debate is waning. I know stakes can be high in a bubble, bid, or important round but let's still come out of the debate feeling as if it was a positive experience. The complexity and dynamic nature of debate can be so rewarding and equally thrilling. But if you pair that with inflexibility, curtness, or even acrimony the debate devolves into a Pyrrhic victory at best for you and a painful experience for us all. Life is too short for needless suffering. Please be kind, compassionate, and cordial. 2022 Winter Stats Update: Importing my Tabroom data I've judged 539 rounds since 2014 with a 54% Pro and 46% Con balance. Not bad. Slight Aff bias it seems. Turkey Topic - For the California Round Robin I'm gonna be real. Lexy spent all this time to get experts for the final round so I would much much prefer to have spec topic debates so we can test who best understands the topic in order to better the discourse for finals. I would LOVE some hyperspecific Turkey links and debates. I'm taking names and motives of specific generals, breakdowns of the importance of key bases and ports, names of weapon systems and knowledge of why they are effective. I don't want to watch generic heg debates unless I have to. Like let's GET INTO THE WEEDS YO. - This is petty but it pulls me out of the round. Erdogan is pronounced: AIR-dÉ-â wahn.  - This topic has many similarities to NATO Septober. On the Russia link debate it can go either way so I need comparative analysis on evidence and warranting. Why are your empirics or reasonings superior to prove causality of the situation getting worse or stablizing? - Don't forget: ""Pireyi deve yapmak"" or ""Don't turn a flea into a camel."" âThis Turkish idiom means aka ""making a mountain out of a molehill."" I really am not looking forward to any pedantic topicality debates about whether this is an argument about NATO benefiting/harming Turkey vs. Turkey benefiting/harming NATO. Like chill. They aren't mutually exclusive and let's be real NATO's strategic interests are so broad now anything can be connected back to its security and stability mission. I also will be hard pressed by any teams that argue the grammatical tense of the topic forecloses past or predictive evidence. ""On balance tea is beneficial to Gabe."" If I drank sweet tea for ten years that would have affected my heart even if now I only drink straight black tea and in the future only drink green. I see those as all viable parts of the debate. Obviously the most relevant and maybe only viable evidence is contemporary, that argument can be made, but that we can't discuss anything else is arbitrary and silly. (PS black tea with nothing added the only way to go. Then, now, forever.""

Email: gabriel.rusk@gmail.com Ramblings on Theory Let me explain why I am writing this. This isn't because I'm right and you're wrong. I'm not trying to convince you. Nor should you cite this formally in round to win said round. Rather, a lot of you care so much about debate and theory in particular gets pretty personal fairly quickly that I want to explain why my hesitancy isn't personal to you either. I am not opposing theory as someone who is opposed to change in Public Forum. - First, I would highly discourage running trigger warning theory in front of me. My grad school research and longstanding work outside of debate has tracked how queer, civil rights advocates, religious minorities, and political dissidents have been extensively censored over time through structural means. The suppression and elimination of critical race theory and BLM from schools and universities is an extension of this. I have found it very difficult to be tabula rasa on this issue. TW/anonymous opt outs are welcome if you so wish to include them, that is your prerogative, but like I said the lack of one is not a debate I can be fair on. Let me be clear. I do not dismiss that ""triggers"" are real. I do not deny your lived experience on face nor claim all of you are, or even a a significant number of you, are acting in bad faith. This is always about balancing tests. My entire academic research for over 8 years was about how structural oppressors abuse these frameworks of ""sin,"" ""harm,"" ""other,"" to squash dissidents, silence suffragettes, hose civil rights marchers, and imprison queer people because of the ""present danger they presented in their conduct or speech."" I also understand that some folks in the literature circles claim there is a double bind. You are opting out of trigger warning debates but you aren't letting me opt out of debates I don't want to have either. First, I will never not listen to or engage in this debate. My discouragement above is rooted in my deep fear that I will let you down because I can't be as fair as I would be on another issue. I tell students all the time tabula rasa is a myth. I still think that. It's a goal we strive for to minimize intervention because we will never eliminate it. Second, I welcome teams to still offer tw and will not penalize you for doing so. Third, discussions on SV, intersectionality, and civil rights are always about trade offs. Maybe times will change but historically more oppression, suppression, and suffering has come from the abuse of the your ""speech does me harm"" principle than it benefits good faith social justice champions who want to create a safe space and a better place. If you want to discuss this empirical question (because dang there are so many sources and this is an appeal to my authority) I would love to chat about it. Next, let me explain some specific reasons why I am resistant to TW theory in debate using terms we use in the literature. There is a longstanding historical, philosophical, and queer/critical theory concern on gatekeeper shift. If we begin drawing more and more abstract lines in terms of what content causes enough or certain ""harm"" that power can and will be co-opted and abused by the equally more powerful. Imagine if you had control over what speech was permitted versus your polar opposite actor in values. Now imagine they, via structural means, could begin to control that power for themselves only. In the last 250 years of the US alone I can prove more instances than not where this gatekeeping power was abused by government and powerful actors alike. I am told since this has changed in the last twenty years with societal movements so should we. I don't think we have changed that significantly. Just this year MAUS, a comic about the Holocaust, was banned in a municipality in Jan 22. Toni Morrison was banned from more than a dozen school districts in 2021 alone. PEN, which is a free press and speech org, tracked more than 125 bills, policies, or resolutions alone this year that banned queer, black, feminist, material be them books, films, or even topics in classrooms, libraries, and universities. Even in some of the bills passed and proposed the language being used is under the guise of causing ""discomfort."" ""Sexuality"" and discussions of certain civil rights topics is stricken from lesson plans all together under these frameworks. These trends now and then are alarming. I also understand this could be minimizing the trauma you relive when a specific topic or graphic description is read in round. I again do not deny your experience on face ever. I just cannot comfortably see that framework co-opted and abused to suppress the mechanisms or values of equality and equity. So are you, Gabe, saying because the other actors steal a tool and abuse that tool it shouldn't be used for our shared common goals? Yes, if the powerful abuse that tool and it does more harm to the arc of history as it bends towards justice than I am going to oppose it. This can be a Heckler's Veto, Assassin's Veto, Poisoning The Well, whatever you want to call it. Even in debate I have seen screenshots of actual men discussing how they would always pick the opt out because they don't want to ""debate girls on women issues in front of a girl judge."" This is of course likely an incredibly small group but I am tired of seeing queer, feminist, or critical race theory based arguments being punted because of common terms or non-graphic descriptions. Those debates can be so enriching to the community and their absence means we are structurally disadvantaged with real world consequences that I think outweigh the impacts usually levied against this arg. I will defend this line for the powerless and will do so until I die. All of these above claims are neither syllogisms or encyclopedias of events. I am fallible and so are those arguments. Hence let us debate this but just know my thoughts. - I am more skeptical of paraphrasing theory than disclosure theory. On the former, I am sympathetic and have seen myself countless times how ""full text"" cases are equally capable of being miscut and clipped. Theoretically there is a possible debate on paraphrasing facilitating abuse easier and there could be a good trade off theory debate had but rarely do I see that done well. On the latter, I am more open to a disclosure theory debate but still remain more resistant than most flow judges to engaging this argument. I will be especially incredulous of your theory argument if I discover your application of theory is principally inconsistent. For example, you are running disclosure or paraphrasing theory against one team for violating but not another team who violated (assuming both judges would have equally been receptive.) There may be other extenuating circumstances that explain the discrepancy in application but they need to be addressed. I am getting better on disclosure theory but let me explain some of my concerns based on anecdotal experiences being in PF for 15 years. For one I have probably judged more rounds than you if you're a competitor. 545 by January 2022. Not a flex but just a survey of what's going on in the circuit. There were actual tournaments last year where more than half of the rounds had cases or arguments exclusively from one or two teams. That's not bad on face. The problem was the vast majority of the debaters using them didn't even understand the cards in a nuanced way to even explain them. I am sorry but if you are one of the top teams in the country a novice or team who wants better arguments are likely to defer to you in trust. The issue was that some of the cards were miscut or extremely powertagged. I thought the wiki was supposed to solve power tagging and evidence ethics? I saw so few indicts or evidence comparison. For example, there was in infamous card from a January topic last year where it was from the copy of the bottom of a corporate blog with no date, warrant, author but I saw it in probably 66% of rounds on the topic. No one interrogated the source that well except for maybe two rounds and the stamp of approval from being on a prominent wiki let it just proliferate more. The wiki didn't solve this problem at all. I think we are getting better I hope. I don't think any serious disclosure team denies this could be a problem but they argue that as a whole putting more evidence on the wiki means more fairness and education for all. I wish someone could start doing analysis on how many more teams are on the wiki, number of cards, etc. I just would like to look at data because I think the competing warrants are strong and need something outside of my experiences to validate said warranting. I am most suspicious of paraphrase theory because virtually every single round I judge with full text I would question if even the full text is cut appropriately. You selecting words while omitting others means you are actively deciding which ones not to read. Just because you are using some of the exact words in an excerpt but still deciding which ones to include to me is barely different than paraphrasing. I think it means it'ss relatively harder to abuse evidence but not by much. If anything I think full text cards are called for less and overtime have become ""power cut."" Like in my disclaimer on the other theory shell none of these arguments are truisms just my inner and honest thoughts to help you make strategic decisions in the round. "
"Hey my name is Venkat Abhishek Sambaraj and I debated all four years of my high school career at local, state, and national level so I am well experienced with the debate community. I focused heavily on Domestic Extemporaneous speaking and Public Forum but also participated in Oratory, Informative, and Congress. My paradigms are as follows: Speech: I weigh analysis over presentation, especially in extemporaneous. Presentation is still required but if you provide solid analysis I may be convinced to give you the higher rank. Oratory and informative of course is all about presentation. Public Forum: Did public forum for three years so I am able to flow and keep track of the round. I like to see clash and please WEIGH, that lets me know what to vote on in the round. Collapsing/crystalizing is important, don't go for every single argument on the flow. Always have frontlines and the second-speaking team should address any attacks made by the opponents. I don't really like to see K's and theories in PF, leave that to LD and Policy. If you ask for a card to be looked at, I will most definitely look at it and if I feel there is a card that's been heavily clashed upon I may request it myself once the round ends. The final thing, when it comes to crossfire ask questions that are relevant and don't be a douche when it comes to questioning. I like aggressiveness but as long as it stays respectful and isn't rude. WSD: I like to see clash and please WEIGH, that lets me know what to vote on in the round. Collapsing/crystalizing is important, don't go for every single argument on the flow. The logic and the strategy of the round is what I value heavily and how it affects the world rather than individual ideals. No k's theories and things all that because those are for LD so don't be arguing with those strategies. The final thing, when it comes to crossfire ask questions that are relevant and don't be a douche when it comes to questioning. I like aggressiveness but as long as it stays respectful and isn't rude. "
I am a parent judge. I have judged several tournaments over the last four years.  I am not fully aware of all the nuanced rules of debate.  Each side should clearly present and defend their case.  They should also respond to all arguments presented by the other side.   I also appreciate debaters that respect the time rules.     
"Alpharetta 21. Emory 25. Email chain: hargunn.sandhu03@gmail.com PF As close the debate is to policy the better---meaning reading evidence and doing ev comparison and so on---tech > truth, I will strictly evaluate arguments off the flow. I am fine with speed. I have judged PF ONLY once before, so keep that in mind. I think disclosure is great. Collapse in final rebuttals, do impact calculus, and write my ballot. I don't know any PF norms, acronyms, etc. Note: I have ZERO TOPIC KNOWLEDGE. Explain acronyms and don't assume I know the limits/consensus on T. General: 1. Tech > Truth. Better debating can easily overcome any of the preferences I have below. Judge instruction is key, especially in the final rebuttals. 2. Good debating requires quality evidence; strong, logical explanation; and contextualization. 3. Online debate: please slow down and enunciate more than you normally would. Clarity should not be sacrificed for speed. Sending analytics might be useful in case internet cuts out. Try to keep your camera on at least during speeches and CX. 4. Racism, sexism, discrimination, or any other problematic actions will result in an L and the lowest speaks. 5. Clipping = L and lowest speaks. If you accuse someone of clipping you must have evidence, if you fail to prove they clipped then you get an auto L. Specifics: 1. K - Personally, I never read a k aff, and rarely went for kritiks on the neg, so keep that i mind. a. K Affs: Fairness is an impact. Clash as an impact is great too. I'm more inclined to vote on t usfg/framework since I have mostly been on this side of the debate. However, I do think the aff can win with impact turns to the negative's model. Heg good, cap good, etc are all good 2nr options. b. Ks: the aff will usually get to weigh the plan. Who cares if fiat isn't real. Specific links, pulling quotes from the 1AC, and in-depth explanation at every level are very important. Avoid large overviews. 2. CPs/DAs: a. CPs: Cool. If undebated, I'll judge kick the CP. I might be a little more receptive to intrinsic perms than most. b. DAs: Turns case is crucial. Politics DAs are good, spin is important. 0% risk is a thing, but hard to get to. 3. Theory: a. Conditionality: Good. Worth noting that I think aff teams rarely capitalize on neg teams' poor defense of condo. b. International CP and Ctrl + f word PICs are bad assuming even debating. Neg leaning on most other theory. 4. T - Assuming even debating, competing interps > reasonability. Precise, contextual evidence is key to winning these debates, for both the aff and the neg, but especially the aff if there's a substantial limits differential. Read cards. Both sides should be clashing over their visions of the topic and the impacts to it. 5. Case: Not a fan of framing pages. Impact Turns are fantastic. Good case debating is underutilized and will be rewarded. Presumption is possible. 6. Misc: - Speaks: I'm prolly a little above average giving them out. Specific strategies are good. It always helps to make the round fun. Quality evidence is good. If you opensource, let me know, + .2 - Insert perm texts - Call me Hargunn, not judge. I'm usually not expressive, and anything I do express is usually not your fault. - Things I prolly won't vote on: ASPEC, death good, and out of round issues "

You'll get a bump in speaks if you do. sharansawlani@gmail.com and uschoolpf@gmail.com - Please don’t shake my hand. - You can ask to look at ev during your partner or opponent's speech/cross. Idk why or when people started considering this as ""stealing prep time"". - Quality of voters> Quantity of voters. - Weigh, weigh, weigh, weigh, weigh. Which weigh? Dat weigh. - Keep the round lighthearted. I think debaters are way too angry now and some humor would be appreciated. Jokes and puns are highly encouraged. - Not a fan of super squirrelly arguments or theory (the next 2 bullets might answer your next questions). Idk too much about K's and im not the best at evaluating them, but if that's what you wanna read just make sure you explain it well. If I'm confused at the end of the debate I promise you won't be happy with my decision. - READ and SEND cut cards. paraphrasing is whack. i wont penalize you for it but if the other team reads theory or tells me to evaluate paraphrased evidence as analytics and not real evidence, it's going to be a really uphill battle. - Disclosure in PF is a good thing. Same thing as paraphrasing; If someone discloses and either a) you do not and they read disclosure theory OR b) you LIE about what you've disclosed, I consider this a TKO. This means if disclosure theory is read in the round then it is basically over. Not disclosing or lying is indefensible. (stolen from Aly Fiebrantz) - Your final focus should be telling me what to write on my ballot. If i don’t have to spend time thinking about how im voting after the round, you and i will both be happy (half of you at least). - Apparently this needs to be clarified now but regardless of speaking order, in the rare situation where there is no offense on either side at the end of the round I will presume neg.

Just make an email chain and send all the evidence you're reading before every speech, it's not hard and cx/ld have been doing it forever, it doesn't put you behind. Also, if for some reason you choose to make the round harder and take more time by not doing an email chain please do not take long to pull up your evidence. I really don't want to set a time limit so just don't take 10 minutes to pull up evidence. The standard should be: if you read it in the speech, expect it to be called (so have the cut card with link and cites ready to go). If you have any questions about what to do in terms of presenting evidence, I have linked the NSDA rules below. I will at least give you 25s for a violation. If your opponents are in violation, make it a voting issue, no cap. I will vote them down. - if you do make it a voting issue, i will call for the evidence in question to make sure there is an actual violation (please don't think it's game over for you if someone calls you out for bad evidence but it's actually legit) https://www.speechanddebate.org/wp-content/uploads/Debate-Evidence-Guide.pdf https://www.speechanddebate.org/wp-content/uploads/HS-Unified-Manual-2019-2020.pdf (command f ""7.1"") - I need cut cards with (at least) a link to the full article - I know this is a lot but there are too many debaters trying to cheat the system with bad evidence and I just want to make it crystal clear how I am judging rounds and that I'm not making up things just as an excuse to vote debaters down (and yes unfortunately I need to make that distinction) Other people I try to judge like/influenced my debate style:  https://www.tabroom.com/index/paradigm.mhtml?judge_person_id=11589 https://www.tabroom.com/index/paradigm.mhtml?judge_person_id=25898 https://www.tabroom.com/index/paradigm.mhtml?judge_person_id=11579 "
"Contact meIf you have any questions about my decisions/debating in college/coaching/prep docs, send everything to. Shenkmanmax@gmail.com Feel free to ask me any other questions before the round if my paradigm isn’t clear enough. I’ll tell the other team the same thing I tell yours. BackgroundI’m a third-year out, debated for four years at a high level so I’m a flow judge. Did PF for five years, worlds for three, extemp a couple times and basic experience in a couple other random events. I did policy at wake Forest as well so I can keep up with whatever you read. PF JudgingRun any argument with me and I’ll understand it/be able to flow it. Honestly I really don’t care what you run as long as it isn’t racist/sexist/homophobic etc.. If you for some reason don’t understand what that means feel free to ask me and I’m happy to clarify. If you run something that clearly does violate those rules I’m happy to drop you and I’ll fully explain myself. Regarding arguments, I really don’t care what you run. I’m going to come into the round with as much of a blank slate as possible and am ready to hear what you tell me. Assume I have a good understanding of the topic, but if you tell me something I’ll assume it’s true unless challenged by the other team. If you read some new argument I haven’t heard before it won’t really change the weight of the argument in the round but it’ll incentivize me to listen closer to you and make the round more interesting. Probably reflected in speaks. For speaking style, if you spread like crazy and aren’t clear then it’s not worth the effort for me. I want to hear some good rounds so pay attention to me as a judge. If you see me put my pen down (obviously harder virtually but same idea) and cross my arms/stop typing for a while it means I’m probably not flowing and you should do something to adapt. I’ll adapt to tournament rules regarding prep time/calling for evidence but as a basic rule if you can’t find a card within a reasonable amount of time I’m not gonna weigh it at all. That includes if you find it after the next speech. How to win the round. Like any other reasonable judge, weighing is by far the easiest way to my ballot. Please do your best to remember that there’s more than one type and level of weighing. As an example, if one team tells me that their impact is bigger but one tells me their impact is a prerequisite, I have no way to evaluate which is more important. Tell me how to weigh your weighing. That’s what the final speeches should really be about, especially final focus. IMPORTANT - PLEASE ALSO REMEMBER THE ROUND ISNT JUST ABOUT ARGUMENTS. Are your opponents being assholes/didn’t disclose or whatever? Read an impact on the importance of debate and weigh it = pretty easy win if they don’t respond. I’ll literally listen to any weighing. Another easy way to win the round is dropped arguments. But please for the love of god understand that I can flow. If an argument wasn’t dropped I’ll know that it wasn’t dropped. Saying that an arg was dropped after they read 12 responses isn’t a way to win the round and will probably lower your speaks. BUT EVEN IF THEY DO DROP AN ARG. IF YOU DONT WEIGH IT AND THEY WEIGH AN ARG I WILL VOTE FOR THE BETTER WEIGHING. TELL ME WHY YOUR STUFF MATTERS. Speaks tbh you probably won’t get a 30 or a 25. I’m generous w speaks but 30s are reserved for the best debaters and speakers. That being said, here’s how I give speaks. The metric is through devaluation, you’ll start with a 30 and they’ll drop every time you mess up. Below are the easiest ways for you to loose speaks and the amount you’ll probably lose. Also I’m fine w low point wins. #1. Being a jerk to your partner. I really don’t care if one of you is better or more experienced with the other. Treat each other with respect and make sure that both partners are active in debate. If you don’t I’m more than happy to drop you 2-3 speaks. #2. Being a jerk to the other team. That doesn’t mean don’t take control of cross or play the round strategically but don’t ruin the debate with aggressiveness. If you need an example of good control look back to Lake Mary Prep rounds. Just why be mean? I want both teams to walk out of the round feeling like it was a good debate either way. Loose 2 here #3. Not speaking well. Yeah I mean this is pretty generic but it’s what most judges give speaks for. Just speak eloquently make sure I understand you and present your arguments well. 1-2 points #4. Other stuff, idk goes round by round 1-2 points "
"PF Paradigm: I am an experienced PF judge on the national circuit. I judge primarily on impacts. You need to give a clear link story backed up with logic and evidence. Framework is important. Weighing is very important. It is better to acknowledge that your opponent may be winning a certain argument and explain how the impacts you are winning outweigh than it is to ignore that argument made by your opponent. Don't extend through ink. If your opponent attacks your argument you need to respond to that attack and not just repeat your original argument. I don't mind rapid conversational speed - especially while reading evidence, but no spreading. I will keep a good flow and judge primarily off the flow, but let's keep PF as an event where persuasive speaking style, logic, evidence, and refutation are all important. Also let's keep PF distinct from national circuit LD and national circuit policy - let's avoid kritiks, disads, plans, counterplans and theory arguments.  LD Paradigm: I am an experienced LD judge. I do prefer traditional style LD. I am, however, OK with plans and counter-plans and I am OK with theory arguments concerning analysis of burdens. I am not a fan of Kritiks. I will try to be open to evaluate arguments presented in the round, but I do prefer that the debate be largely about the resolution instead of largely centered on theory. I am OK with fast conversational speed and I am OK with evidence being read a little faster than fast conversational as long as tag lines and analysis are not faster than fast conversational. I do believe that V / VC are required, but I don't believe that the V / VC are voting issues in and of themselves. That is, even if you convince me that your V / VC is superior (more important, better linked to the resolution) than your opponent's V / VC that is not enough for me to vote for you. You still need to prove that your case better upholds your V / VC than your opponent's case does. To win, you may do one of three things: (1) Prove that your V / VC is superior to your opponent's AND that your case better upholds that V / VC than your opponent's case does, OR (2) Accept your opponent's V / VC and prove that your case better upholds their V/VC than their case does. OR (3) Win an ""even-if"" combination of (1) and (2). CX Paradigm: I am an experienced LD and PF judge (nationally and locally). I have judged policy debate at a number of tournaments over the years - including the final round of the NSDA national tournament in 2015. However, I am more experienced in PF and LD than I am in policy. I can handle speed significantly faster than the final round of NSDA nationals, but not at super-fast speed. (Evidence can be read fast if you slow down for tag lines and for analysis.) Topicality arguments are fine. I am not a fan of kirtiks or critical affs. "
"Hello debaters! I’m a university student studying philosophy and sociology and was a debater throughout high school for three years. My main proficiency was with Lincoln-Douglas debate and Congressional debate but I am very familiar with Public Forum, Policy, and IDPA debate (and, to a lesser extent, British Parliament and World Schools Debate). For preemption, my pronouns are any/all and my email is njudesims@gmail.com. NOTE: I have hearing loss as a result of several ear canal surgeries in my childhood. My inner ear tissue is scarred and my speech perception is affected as a result. This is not an issue of volume, it is an issue of clarity and enunciation. As a result, I cannot understand spreading. It is simply out of my ear's reach. Do not spread. I will not understand you. For Lincoln-Douglas: -Do not spread. Take the L. -You must have a Value and Criterion. Lincoln Douglas is all about framing topics with an ethical framework. When we say that something is moral or immoral, we must do so with an ethical framework (i.e., consequentialism, deontology, virtue ethics). While having a value of Morality is technically allowable, it is an assumed value--Lincoln Douglas is already a moral debate, making a value of morality redundant and unnecessary. What framework I assume by and large determines how I examine the debate as a whole. If your framework doesn't exist, you will lose. -Ethical theories are not values. You cannot 'value' utilitarianism--it is an ethical framework through which we examine values. We can examine the utility of 'freedom' as a value, but we cannot simply value utilitarianism. -My decision will largely be made on appeals to ethics, and philosophical consistency. I don't care if you bury your opponent in evidence on a specific point--you must prove to me that your ethical framework is better than your opponent's at achieving your value, and why I should prefer it. LD is an ethical debate, and the main focus of my decision will be based on how well ethical arguments are made. This is not to say I do not value evidence--I simply do not care how much evidence you possess. For Public Forum: -Focus on broader impacts. Signpost these clearly--what specific, concrete reasons should I prefer your position on this topic? -Do not spend too much time on one specific point with one specific point of evidence. Give weight to what's important. -Be light on the jargon. I don't eat, breathe, and sleep PF so it's not likely I'll be able to keep up with the seventeen turns and de-linkages you specify within one minute. For Policy (read all, please): -Don't even think about spreading. If you go too fast, I'll say 'clear.' -Please do not force me to rely on an email chain to decide the round. -On topicality: I am pretty lenient when it comes to whether a plan is topical or not. My standard for determining this is whether or not the plan fits in what I conceive as the ""spirit of the resolution."" Something may not be strictly topical as per the verbiage of the resolution, but is still topical as it fits the resolution's intended spirit as written. The only times I will flatly reject a plan on topicality is (1) if it is too large in scope, as to encompass the resolution rather than the other way around, or (2) it is so disconnected from the topic that it may as well be a non-sequitur. As an additional note, please don't waste time making a bunch of topicality arguments. It is boring and time-consuming, and chances are, you won't convince me. -Kritiks annoy me in a special kind of way. They're used as a way to cheaply sidestep the resolution to win by making an argument that can be ostensibly copied from round to round. The only time I am less annoyed by kritiks is if they're abolition kritiks advocating the pointed abolition of an unjust group of specified systems--the point of which is to say that the resolution in question overly limits available discourse.

"I did PF at Marist in high school and I'm currently in my second year coaching there. I am a sophomore at the University of Georgia I vastly prefer an email chain over a doc. Please add maristpublicforum@gmail.com to the chain Debate is first and foremost a safe and educational activity so we should do our best to keep it that way General thoughts: Extend every part of the argument... uniqueness, link, internal link, and impact. And remember that a claim without a warrant is not an argument. If you do not extend your argument then I can not vote on it. I cannot stress enough that fewer well developed arguments will always be better than blips with no argument development or good warrants. I've noticed teams that collapse and more thoroughly explain their arguments tend to win my ballot more often than not against a team that goes for too much. Please weigh. Weighing jargon is weird. Just stick to probability, timeframe/ prerequisites, and magnitude Second rebuttal must answer first rebuttal How I will evaluate debates: Arguments:  I don’t really care what type of argument you read as long as it is well explained, has warrants, and is weighed (case, k’s, theory... whatever are all fine). You do what you're best at and I'll judge it accordingly. Speed: You can go as fast or slow as you want, just be clear. I won't have any issue flowing any speed you decide to go. Evidence: I'd really prefer you read cut cards, some debates are getting pretty out of hand with just paragraph dumps of paraphrased. Debate is an activity about high quality research not writing a persuasive english paper. If you paraphrase then you really need to have the cut cards ready at a minimum. A card is not cut if it does not have a complete and correct cite as well as the important/ cited parts of the card being emphasized. Evidence should be able to be sent when ask for in a timely manner. If it is not sent quickly it may be dropped from the debate Theory leanings:  Theory is a good way to check back against abusive practices in the activity I truly believe paraphrasing is bad and disclosure is good and I often went for theory when debating, but that being said, I wont be biased when judging it. I generally think that good is good enough when it comes to theory right now in PF. For example if a team reads open source disclosure theory and the other team discloses on the wiki but not open source that is good enough and it'll be harder to win that debate. Arguments like these are fine but there will be a lower threshold for responses and I will definitely be sympathetic to reasonability claims from the other team. I tend to default to competing interps and no RVI's but the more frivolous the theory the more this changes. I will drop you if you read silly stuff like shoe or speaker point theory "
"Hi! I competed in PF at Nova High School in South Florida from 2014 to 2019. I'm now a student at Duke University and this is my third year coaching PF at Durham Academy. How I make decisions- I tend to vote on the path of least resistance. This is the place on my flow where I need to intervene the least as a judge in order to make a decision. Explicitly identifying your cleanest piece of offense in the round, winning that clean piece of offense, completely extending that clean piece of offense (uniqueness, links AND impacts in BOTH summary and final focus), and then telling me why your cleanest piece of offense is more important than your opponents' cleanest piece of offense is usually an easy way to win my ballot. General Stuff- - Second rebuttal isn’t required to frontline but I do think it is really strategic to do so (especially turns). - First summary doesn't need terminal defense (I guess you could say its ~sticky~ even though that word is gross). - I think a lot of debaters give ""flow"" judges too much credit for knowing things. I can only vote on arguments I understand by the end of the round. If your argument is still unclear to me after 4 speeches and 3 crossfires, thats your fault not mine. While I do coach and usually know the resolution well, please do not assume I know everything. - I used to be okay with speed, but I've noticed lately that teams are using ""sending a speech doc"" as an excuse to go super fast AND not be clear. So feel free to send a speech doc but I will not read it. If I don't understand your speech because its too fast/unclear, thats your fault. You should slow down and be more clear. Evidence- - I personally feel that calling for evidence as a judge is interventionist. I will only do it if 1- someone in the round explicitly tells me to in a speech or 2- reading evidence is literally the only way that I can make a decision (if this happens, it means both teams did a terrible job of clarifying the round and there is no clear offense for me to vote on. Please don't let this happen). Progressive Stuff- - I'll vote on Kritiks if they are clearly warranted, well explained, and made accessible to your opponents. (I am admittedly not a fan of K's but will vote on them if I must.) - I will also vote on theory that is clearly explained, fleshed out, and well warranted. I believe that theory should ONLY be used to check egregious instances of in-round abuse. So running it to waste time, get a cheap win, or exclude your opponents from the debate will result in low speaks and possibly a loss if you annoy me enough. I won't buy paraphrase or disclosure theory. - I'm also not super confident in my ability to evaluate progressive args so proceed with caution. - If you plan on reading arguments about sensitive topics, please provide a trigger/content warning before the round. Please work to maintain debate as a safe space and refrain from reading potentially triggering arguments if someone in the round asks you not to. If you have any questions as to what a content warning is, how to go about reading a content warning, or if you're unsure if you should read one- let me know before the round. I'm more than happy to help you! With that being said, I am very receptive to trigger warning theory if one is either not read or violated. Overall- - This should really go without saying but- racist, xenophobic, sexist, classist, homophobic, and other oppressive discourses or examples have no place in debate. If I deem your behavior to be excessively rude, condescending, arrogant, or hateful, I reserve the right to intervene and drop you. Hopefully this covered everything but if you still have questions after reading please feel free to ask before the round!  "
"Hello! My name is Victoria and I am a sophomore in college. I did public forum debate from 7th-11th grade, and for that reason am a flow judge. Make sure to extend your arguments throughout the round, address what has been dropped, and address framework (if one is given). In the final speeches, give me clear voters. Logic and reason are still important to me, so just extending an argument isn't enough: explain your link chain, and convince me! I also prefer that teams keep track of their own time, and don't take too long finding and sending cards.  "
"I debated in policy for The Blake School for four years (2009-2013) and then I debated for Rutgers University-Newark in college (2013-2017). I ran mostly policy based arguments in high school and mostly critical arguments in college. I was an assistant coach (policy and public forum) with the Blake School until 2019, now I teach/coach debate (policy and congress) at Success Academy Midtown West and Harlem West. Feel free to run any arguments you want whether it be critical or policy based. The only thing that will never win my ballot is any argument about why racism, sexism, etc. is good. Other than that do you. I do not have many specific preferences other than I hate long overviews - just make the arguments on the line-by-line. I am not going to read your evidence unless there is a disagreement over a specific card or if you tell me to read a specific card. I am not going to just sit and do the work for you and read a speech doc. I am not as familiar with the post-modern literature - so just make sure you are clearly explaining the alternative. Most of the K literature I know well is race and gender based. Note on clash of civ debates - I tend to mostly only judge clash of civ debates - In these debates I find it more persuasive if you engage the aff rather than just read framework. But that being said I have voted on framework in the past. PF - Please please please read real cards. If its not in the summary I won't evaluate it in the final focus. Do impact calculus. Stop calling for cards if you aren't going to do the evidence comparison. I will increase your speaker points if you do an email chain with your cards prior to your speech. "
"The Blake School (Minneapolis, MN) I am the director of debate where I teach communication and coach Public Forum and World Schools. I also coach the USA Development Team and Team USA in World Schools Debate. Public Forum Some aspects that are critical for me 1) Be nice and respectful. Try to not talk over people. Share time in crossfire periods. Words matter, think about what you say about other people. Attack their arguments and not the people you debate. 2) Arguments must be extended in each speech. This idea of ""sticky defense"" and not answering arguments in the second rebuttal doesn't understand how debate works. A debater can only make strategic choices about their speech if they base it on what was said in the speech previous to them. 3) Read evidence. I don't accept paraphrasing -- this is an oral activity. If you are quoting an authority, then quote the authority. A debater should not have to play ""wack a mole"" to find the evidence you are using poorly. Read a tag and then quote the card, that allows your opponent to figure out if you are accurately quoting the author or over-claiming the evidence. 4) Have your evidence ready. If an opponent asks for a piece of evidence you should be able to produce it in about 60 seconds. At two minutes or so, I'm going to just say the evidence doesn't count in the round because you can't produce it. If I say the card doesn't count then the card doesn't count in the round. If you say you can't produce the card then you risk losing. That is called fabrication to cite evidence and then not be able to produce it. If I ask for a card after the round and you can't produce it, again you risk losing the round. Good evidence practices are critical if this format is to rely on citing authorities. 5) I tend to be a policymaker. If there is no offense against trying a new policy then I suggest we try the new policy as it can't hurt to try. Offense is important for both sides. 6) Use voting issues format in summary and final focus. Learn that this allows a clear story and weighing. A voting issue format includes links, impacts, and weighing and provides clarity to just ""our case/their case"". You are still doing the voting issues on ""their flow"" or ""our flow"". 7) Lead with labels/arguments and NOT authors. Number your arguments. For example, 1) Turn UBI increases wage negotiation -- Jones in 2019 states ""quote"" 8) Racist, xenophobic, sexist, classist, homophobic, transphobic, ableist, and other oppressive discourses or examples have no place in debate. Enjoy the debate and learn from this activity, it is a great one. "
"Email Chain: jsydnor@altamontschool.org -- please add. I believe debaters should send speech docs -- whether through NSDA Campus file transfer or an email chain -- regardless of how fast you intend to speak. Doing so checks back tech failures, encourages evidence engagement, and discourages 3 hours of free prep ev prep mid-debate. Background: Former college and high school national circuit policy debater. Several years coaching Lincoln-Douglas and Public Forum. Argument Choice: I am generally open to and find value in all forms of debate, and I try to evaluate arguments with minimal judge intervention. However, I will intervene in cases like enforcing NSDA established rules on things like speech times, evidence protocol, etc. I also generally believe arguments like “racism good” or “sexism good” are untenable and independent voting issues separate from topical debate. Speed: I can usually handle spreading and flow-heavy debates, just don’t neglect clarity. Debate is a communication-based activity, so if you cannot adequately communicate to me your argument then I feel justified saying I did not evaluate that part of the debate. Sending speech docs is not a substitute for being intelligible; you still have the burden of communicating what you’re reading. Digital debate is also not helping anyone be more clear as voices get warped, lagged, and distorted by the form in which the debate takes place. Even if tech failures are inevitable, there’s a vast difference in me not hearing 2 arguments slowly spoken and warped versus 22 theory subpoints spewed and misunderstood because of lag. Just be careful. ——— PUBLIC-FORUM ——— Evidence: I enforce the NSDA established protocols for what’s required in debates in terms of having cards ready for opponents and judges with proper citation are clarified rule similar to speech times, contextualized by whatever decisions are announced by the tournament. This is not a “personal choice,” even if other judges choose not to enforce. I abide by the NSDA clarification on paraphrasing: it’s acceptable, but you still have to have evidence paraphrased available in card format for in-round engagement and judge decision making. It is your burden to make sure you get the evidence your opponent is citing either immediately before or after they speak (preferably before). You don't need to take prep time to send/email ev, just don't take forever -- good debaters should have good evidence organization anyway. I won't intervene if you don't ask, but I will intervene if they refuse to share it to maintain standards. I don't pause prep time or cross-x so you can read your opponent's evidence, but will pause prep if we’re waiting on something like an email to come through. CP/K’s/Plans/Progressive: This is awkward given the aforementioned discussion of being stricter on evidence. Some of these types of arguments are explicitly banned by the NSDA -- a ban that I do not necessarily believe in, and serves as a content/form regulation that no other type of debate observes at the level of rule-making. I think many of these arguments would make debate better. However, it’s in the same documents that setup things like speech times and evidence policy, and I jurisdictionally have to default to their exclusion unless a team makes a compelling argument for why I shouldn’t exclude. Tell me why it’s an important style of debate and why my ballot helps with norm setting. Likewise, if you’re debating this, why is it unfair for them to introduce this? Long story short: I am a little more open to progressive arguments, but also have to do my job as a judge in an event that has procedurally limited out certain argument styles. ——— LINCOLN-DOUGLAS ——— Ideologically I default into the policy/K ""progressive"" camp over traditional or phil/trick heavy style. K’s: As a debater I primarily leaned towards the K. I believe K debate is at its best when its enactment of the critique features deep engagement with the specificity of what happened in the 1AC. Please don't assume I'm head deep in the latest, greatest Bataille, Baudrillard, or high theory lit. I reward debaters on either side who can engage the K lit and its relation to the Aff with clarity and strategy. K/Performance/Nontopical Affs: I think these are great. I just want a clear reason why you chose your methodology over a more “instrumental” or truth-testing approach. The Neg has to in generate substantial offense against what the Aff did methodologically, even if it's T/Framework, if they hope to beat these Affs. CP’s: Great in their many forms. Go for it. Aff wise: I am willing to listen to some whole-res args that dismiss the role of CP’s since the role of the debate is not as much about implementation or significance of calculating opportunity costs. Theory: This is fine, but I admittedly might not be the best judge for it, especially when straying away from conditionality, PICs, framework theory land, and into incredibly arbitrary disclosure violations that shift to exclude whatever the debater didn’t do. I use to think RVI’s were silly, but I’m growing more sympathetic in certain circumstances given the use and abuse of theory in LD. Topicality: Necessary part of the arsenal. The topic is generally the locus of discussion. I generally believe that when dealing with plan-based debates the Aff still has the burden of maintaining a topical advocacy, that the negative gets T to check back Affs that might have a bad interp for debate, and that the Aff doesn't get a ballot just because they did their duty to be topical. I generally default competing interpretations unless sold otherwise. The exception to all these notes on T is a K Aff strat that challenges interpretations based on instrumental affirmation and can win disads to the act of T. Spikes/Traps/Tricks/1AC Excessive Underview Nonsense: Grouping the diversity of these all together - sometimes this feels less about smart arguments and instead rewarding “gotcha!” argumentation over substantive engagement. I understand why you do this and have voted on it. I am also sympathetic to theory arguments that could reject you for your practices or at the very least give your opponent room in terms of argument engagement. "
"I do not believe in judging paradigms. I don’t feel that my opinions on debate or how a round should go should affect my decision. Any paradigm-like views I should or might have should be justified by debaters in the round like a framework. Any thoughts I as the judge have on the round should come from the round, not my opinions on debate. "
"I coached Public Forum starting from its beginning in 2002 until I retired from teaching in 2011. I have continued on as an active judge: judging at the local, state, and national levels. Nearly all of my judging in recent years has been Policy but with Lincoln Douglas and some Public Forum in the mix.PF: In the traditional spirit of Public Forum, the debate is best presented in a clear, understandable manner. PF is a relatively short, quick-paced form of debate. Complexity is fine but be judicious. Stay focused and relatively succinct. Communicate well. I judge Policy, but spreading has no place in PF - at least for me. If I can’t follow what you are saying, well…  Base your contentions on reliable evidence. Draw conclusions using sound reasoning. Clash (of ideas) is great. Obnoxious, aggressive behavior, if it gets ugly, may cost a round. Limited tag-teaming during crossfire is OK. A strong final focus can often win a close round. LD:Questions worth considering are: What is good (or at least the greater good), and what form should it take in the real world? Philosophers have had a lot to say about this. But so does common sense. Consider me the man on the street who sometimes digs philosophers when they also have their feet on the ground. Using a good strategy can be a winner. Getting beyond philosophy and reason, within limits, emotional appeals can be persuasive. Moral, ethical and philosophical perspectives should be a foundation for your case. Policy: I characterize myself as a ""Policy Maker Judge."" I can handle a modest amount of spreading but don't overdo it. It's more effective to rely on the quality of arguments and evidence than on quantity. Substance counts and so does style. Limited tag-teaming is OK. It is a real art to be confrontational while also being genuinely respectful of your opponent.While Kritiks are a worthy part of Policy debate, I have never found them to be a decisive, or sometimes even a relevant, factor in my decisions. For some judges they are significant so when there is a panel, feel free to use them. Just be sure to present a strong arguments that support or negate the Affirmative case. Learn from your experience. Do what you do best. Enjoy the competition! "
"Hey everyone, My name is Jack I’m a junior at Fordham University studying Finance and Econ. I did PF for 4 years in HS and loved it. I’d say I’m pretty flay. I will be flowing but I also value things like crossfire (assuming they still have that) and overall debate perception, that is who it seems won the round. That is an important aspect out of the PF world. I currently do Mock Trial at Fordham, PF is way better. Don’t be a jerk, but also totally okay with calling out opponents out for logical inconsistencies. Looking forward to the rounds! "
"i did PF in high school (2014-18) and coached for ~2 years after. as a warning, i have not thought about debate in the past 2 years (i only think about kpop), i don't have topic knowledge, and am not comfy with technical/theory-ish things in PF. please treat me like a flay judge! i like seeing lots of impact calc, meta/weighing throughout the round along w/ a clean narrative — doing all of these well will mean i give u high speaks (29+). i will lower speaker points for teams that are mean :( btw u can wear whatever u want in rounds. having to wear a suit for online tournaments is basically child abuse. more importantly, i hope you are having a good day!!! sanjim@berkeley.edu "
"TL;DR: I think I'm slowly becoming a flay judge :( Taken directly from @Gabe Rusk for Emory 2022 (there are only two modifications, listed at the very bottom): Drug Debate FYI Emory's rules on prep and evidence exchange: 4 minutes of prep (RR is still 3) and""When requested, teams have one minute to produce evidence. If requests for multiple pieces of evidence are made, the exchange should occur in a comparable time frame. At the end of the minute, if the team cannot produce the evidence, preparation time for that team will then be used to locate that evidence. The team may choose to have the evidence dropped from the round if they choose."" First, the detailed implementation of the resolution isn't obvious. Whilst we can't offer plans in PF we can speculate on what is the most likely form of implementation. Legalization can take many forms and can be based on existing proposals in congress, based on state models, or even models abroad. If your argument is contingent upon a facet of legalization that is not reasonably inherent to the process please provide evidence and warranting to why this would be a likely feature. I.E. lobbying watering down regulations, substance abuse programs being mandated as a portion of tax revenue, therapeutic legalization for certain drugs only. These are all features that require additional support in my opinion and are not inherent to a generic legalization process. Just provide the evidence or warranting to why they would be likely. Also on the reverse please don't quip that legalization wouldn't look like that. Why? You need competing evidence or warranting to why that feature wouldn't be included. Second, for the classic debate about price, use, and abuse. Both sides are trying to access increasing or decreasing trends as a result of the resolution. Do not. I repeat do not just throw back and forth case studies of prices going up or down. Use going up or down. Abuse going up or down. Compare them! Is one case study better than another? Do you have a meta study? Do you have a study that is most recent or longitudinal? I am especially not sympathetic to the lazy argument that ""your evidence is just from a state or country that decriminalized so it's irrelevant to this debate. Legalization and decriminalization is different."" Of course it is but legalization is the erasure of all penalties including criminal and civil within the regulations the governments set up. Explain to me why the distinction matters in this evidence debate and do not just say they are different. What if the evidence debate is close? What warranting makes more sense? This also gets to net or gross weighing of impacts. Y'all.... it can be simultaneously true that abuse, use, and prices go up and down but at different times or have total net differences. Please be clear on when these trends happen, why that matters in the short and long term, and more importantly what the net effects are. Third, uncarded or unwarranted claims. Due to the rhetoric around this topic in the real world I have found judging rounds to be plagued with more asserted claims than with other topics. You can't just say LSD is bad. You can't just say weed is good. Provide evidence and warranting for claims just like you would other topics. There are a bunch of built in biases we have on topics but I think you are assuming based on decades of bad media and policy exposure there are claims that need no support on this topic. Maybe but it's rare. ""We turned their LSD good argument because it's bad!"" Ok this debate can be fruitful. Compare the studies? Are there meaningful differences in who was studied? When? Is there decent evidence on both sides? Engage the warranting. For example, you could explain to me biochemically what is going on in a brain that does heroin and why that creates a neurological and biochemical dependency cycle etc. Give me something to compare.

"I debated at Basis Chandler in high school and currently debate at Emory University. Please add me on the email chain at aadiwaghray@gmail.com. Policy I have next to know knowledge of the high school topic. This means if there are topic specific terms, acronyms, etc. It would be helpful to have it defined/ read in context one time in the debate. Also, I am going to need a little more explanation on topicality. I am not the best at speed especially when debating online. But, if you are clear and good at signposting, I shouldn't have a problem. While I will refer to the speech doc, I expect to not have to look at it to render my decision. While I am familiar with some K lit, you are probably better of not running high theory in front of me. My default framework will be that the K gets links to what the aff said and did, and the aff gets to weigh the implementation of the plan. I can be swayed from this position. Also, large overviews with a million cross applications are not as flowable as you think. In terms of traditional arguments, I debated smaller affs in high school so I am sympathetic to impact defense pushes on both the aff and the neg. I do not abide by try-or-die. The DA needs to actually have a chance to happen and the aff needs to solve for something. Please don't steal prep time. Public Forum I have never debated public forum. Since my background is in Policy, I will be on the more progressive/ technical side. This means that I will vote almost exclusively based on the flow. Also, if you are able to clearly follow the flow and signpost well, your speaks will be significantly higher than if you are just rhetorically powerful. This does not mean you need to spread. A blippy argument will still lose to one that is well developed. "
"PF: four turns equals a square and I have the power of god and anime on my side TLDR: tech judge, defense is sticky for 1summ, if you don't extend case in both speeches, im capping your speaks at a 27, will vote on K's and theory. safety first, for any specific questions about this pls read my paradigm. i will be very unhappy if you do not show up to the round at the check in time. Important info for this topic (I edit this every topic): you need to know your conflict scenarios and flesh them out to the max. this will take a lot of the heavy lifting out of the weighing debate.  add me to the email chain alex.watson.2021@gmail.com For any other questions, read: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DUAk_GjZJBvD4iNQz69oIYEwygf2uHCenFzgkFtYC5M/edit?usp=sharing LD and Policy: Please send speech docs with fully typed analyts and full tags. Also these are not my home events so sorry if I make a bad call. Feel free to post round me. "
"MAIN STUFF I will make whichever decision requires the least amount of intervention. I don't like to do work for debaters but in 90% of rounds you leave me no other choice.  I have a very high threshold for extensions, saying the phrase ""extend our 1st contention/our impacts"" will get you lower speaks and a scowl.  You need to re-explain your argument from fiat to impact in order to properly ""extend"" something in my eyes. This goes for turns too, don't extend turns without an impact. I need parallelism (summary+FF) for any offense you want me to vote for. I realize this is controversial, but I don’t require defense in summary, although it usually makes sense to extend in 2nd summ once you know what offense your opponent is going for. With that being said, if your opponents frontline case in 2nd rebuttal, you need to answer back their frontlines in 1st summary if you still wanna go for that defense. Defense is most important for me in Final Focus though, so if you want me to delink/NU the offense they're going for, blow it up in FF. (Long story short, good pieces of defense can be extended as terminal D from rebuttal to FF if not answered by your opponents.) Presumption flows neg. If you want me to default to the first speaking team you'll need to make an argument. In that case though you should probably just try to win some offense. SPEAKING PREFS I like analytical arguments, not everything needs to be carded to be of value in a round. (Warrants ) Signpost pls. Roadmaps are a waste of time 98% of the time. I love me some good framework. Highly organized speeches are the key to high speaks in front of me. Try to get on the same page as your opponents as often as possible, agreements make my decision easier and make me respect you more as a debater (earning you higher speaks). Strategic concessions make me happy. The single best way to get good speaks in front of me is to implicate your opponent's rebuttal response(s) or crossfire answers against them in a speech. Frontlining in second rebuttal is smart but not required. It’s probably a good idea if they read turns. Reading more than 1 or 2 different weighing mechanisms is a waste of time because 10 seconds of meta-weighing OHKOs. When teams fail to meta-weigh or interact impacts I have to intervene, and that makes me sad.  Don’t extend every single thing you read in case. PROCEDURAL LOGISTICS My email is devon@victorybriefs.com I'm not gonna call for cards unless they're contested in the round and I believe that they're necessary for my RFD. I think that everyone else that does this is best case an interventionist judge, and worst case a blatant prep thief. Skipping grand is cringe. Stop trying to act like you're above the time structure. I may look like I’m timing stuff, but I just like to watch the clock run. Track each other’s prep.  PROG STUFF Theory's fine, usually frivolous in PF. Love RVIs . Genuinely believe disclosure is bad for the event, paraphrasing is good, but I won't intervene against a shell you're winning. I will vote for kritikal args if you win/extend role of the ballot :-) Just because you're saying the words structural violence in case doesn't mean you're reading a K.

"Background Director of Speech & Debate at Taipei American School in Taipei, Taiwan. Founder and Director of the Institute for Speech and Debate (ISD). Formerly worked/coached at Hawken School, Charlotte Latin School, Delbarton School, The Harker School, Lake Highland Prep, Desert Vista High School, and a few others. Updated for Online Debate I coach in Taipei, Taiwan. Online tournaments are most often on US timezones - but we are still competing/judging. That means that when I'm judging you, it is the middle of the night here. I am doing the best I can to adjust my sleep schedule (and that of my students) - but I'm likely still going to be tired. Clarity is going to be vital. Complicated link stories, etc. are likely a quick way to lose my ballot. Be clear. Tell a compelling story. Don't overcomplicate the debate. That's the best way to win my ballot at 3am - and always really. But especially at 3am. williamsc@tas.tw is the best email for the evidence email chain. Paradigm You can ask me specific questions if you have them...but my paradigm is pretty simple - answer these three questions in the round - and answer them better than your opponent, and you're going to win my ballot: 1. Where am I voting? 2. How can I vote for you there? 3. Why am I voting there and not somewhere else? I'm not going to do work for you. Don't try to go for everything. Make sure you weigh. Both sides are going to be winning some sort of argument - you're going to need to tell me why what you're winning is more important and enough to win my ballot. If you are racist, homophobic, nativist, sexist, transphobic, or pretty much any version of ""ist"" in the round - I will drop you. There's no place for any of that in debate. Debate should be as safe of a space as possible. Competition inherently prevents debate from being a 100% safe space, but if you intentionally make debate unsafe for others, I will drop you. Period. One suggestion I have for folks is to embrace the use of y'all. All too often, words like ""guys"" are used to refer to large groups of people that are quite diverse. Pay attention to pronouns (and enter yours on Tabroom!), and be mindful of the language you use, even in casual references. I am very very very very unlikely to vote for theory. I don't think PF is the best place for it and unfortunately, I don't think it has been used in the best ways in PF so far. Also, I am skeptical of critical arguments. If they link to the resolution, fantastic - but I don't think pre-fiat is something that belongs in PF. If you plan on running arguments like that, it might be worth asking me more about my preferences first - or striking me. "
"pronouns: she/her/hers Hey! I'm a first year at Emory University, and I did PF for four years in high school on the national and local circuit. I'm now debating policy on Emory's team. Debate is absolutely my favorite activity, and it makes me happy. Overall, I hope you enjoy the round/have fun. Include me in the email chain! miranda.wilson@emory.edu My preferences: -I will vote off the flow, but I have to buy your argument. For example, if you extend something all the way into final but it's not warranted/explained I won't vote off of it. Rather than ""tech over truth"" or ""truth over tech"", I'm more of a tech should equal truth (if that makes sense?). -The flow is important to me but so is narrative. When determining speaks, I will look at how effectively you combined evidence with rhetoric. -I can handle speed, but do not spread. -Please frontline in second rebuttal! -I will not flow disads in second rebuttal. Rebuttal is not the time to add in a third contention or argument, it is a time for defense. -The same cards/arguments/weighing need to be extended in both summary and final focus. Please give me a clear weighing mechanism and explain it! It will make my job much easier. -Signpost!!!!!!!!! -I find historical precedent extremely important and love when it's argued in round. I also love framework debates; I think good framework can be used really effectively (same thing as above though, I have to buy it). -I love unique arguments!! However, I do not have much experience with theory, and I don't think PF is necessarily the place for it. I'm willing to hear it, but I can't promise you'll be happy with how I evaluate it. -Please don't misinterpret evidence. I'm begging you. There are so many articles out there. Find a piece of evidence that says what you want it to say instead of misconstruing. Don't be surprised if I call for evidence at the end of a round, especially if it gets indicted. -To extend evidence you don't necessarily have to extend the citation, just make sure the content of the card stays consistent. -I hate when arguments get muddled. If you don't have a good response, then just try to outweigh: don't muddle. -I will disclose and give an RFD if both teams want/the tournament allows. Miscellaneous: -Be respectful. I have dealt with a lot of sexism during my time in debate, and if you are condescending in anyway I will dock your speaks. Any racist, homophobic, or sexist arguments and you will automatically lose. -If you don't know someone's pronouns in round (they have not explicitly said them), it's probably best to default to they/them. I do appreciate when debaters post their pronouns before round in the chat. -If you make me laugh, have clever contention names, or somehow make a relevant Harry Potter reference I'll give you an extra speaker point. -I don't mind if you skip grand cross because it's awkward if no one has any questions. I won't flow first and second cross, but I will consider it for speaks, etc. -If your opponent didn't drop an argument, then don't say they dropped it. Also, don't extend through ink. -Feel free to ask any questions after the round! -Have fun:) "
"Good afternoon students! I am looking for good premises that can strongly support your conclusions. Logical fallacies such as bias fallacy will weaken your argument so please try to minimize logical fallacies as much as possible. Throughout your argument, please make sure the premises are true and that they are strongly needed for your conclusions to stand. Also please make sure to work collaboratively with your teammates as teamwork is essential in any debate. Thank you and have fun! I look forward to judging your arguments and I know all of you will do very well! "
"I am a parent judge. Relatively new to judging PF. Be considerate of my experience levels. I value logic and evidence. Being respectful to opponents matters too.  For email chain, please use: ly2005@gmail.com "
"I am a parent judge who enjoys hearing innovative arguments. I have judged about 15 tournaments and more than 50 rounds of TOC/Varsity level of PF competitions. Below is a list of my criteria: 1. I prefer each team to provide a speech document for at least the cases and rebuttals with cards. It makes the evidence exchange professional, efficient, and fair, while allowing the judge to go back to check the evidence for clarification and validity if necessary. 2. Signpost is highly appreciated. 3. Collapsing in the back half is highly encouraged and appreciated. Also, the final focus is important for my decision, anything you want me to evaluate should be in the last speech. 4. I am okay with speed up to 220 words per minute. Speed is usually always fine, if it is well organized with signposts, and clearly delivered. 5. Tech over truth. It’s your burden to disprove your opponents’ absurdity. Comments such as “this is ludicrous” without a warrant will just make me laugh. 6. Theory running is appreciated in the debate. in fact, any argumentation is encouraged if there is a sound explanation/defense. However, make sure you explain what the jargon means when debating theoretical arguments. 7. Personally, I believe the practice of disclosing arguments on the wiki is in the best interest of the debate community’s well-being, and should become a norm, at least in varsity debate competitions. 8. I do not have a preference of paraphrasing, but evidence ethics is an important voting issue for me. For example, misrepresenting evidence in extremely egregious manner should be considered a fatal error and can’t be overlooked. However, minor infractions should not be zealously prosecuted. 9. If you beat your opponents in crossfire, you need to extend it into the speeches to score points in my evaluation. "
